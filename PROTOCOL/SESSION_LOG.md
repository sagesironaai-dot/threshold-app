FILES_MODIFIED:
  - CLAUDE.md — COMPLETE ("no myth in code" rule corrected: applies to .js
    function/method names only, not canonical system identifiers or enum values)
  - DOCS/SOT_BUILD_TODO.md — COMPLETE (Item 1 first sub-item marked [~],
    s01–s20 progress noted, s21–s40 blocked on cleanup noted)
  - DOCS/Systems/TAG VOCABULARY.md — CREATED (s01–s20 signal seeds complete,
    160+ tags with full routing, duplicates register, routing reference,
    threshold cross-reference section — CONTAMINATED with arcPhase, needs replacement)
  - DOCS/ARCPHASE_ROT_CLEANUP.md — CREATED (complete cleanup map: 13 infected
    files, 9 aetherroot spelling files, verification greps, open field name
    question, TAG VOCABULARY status at time of writing)
  - memory/arcphase_rot.md — CREATED (permanent memory: arcPhase is rot,
    12 threshold states, aetherroot spelling, grep at every session open)
  - memory/MEMORY.md — CREATED (index initialized with arcphase_rot pointer)
COMPLETED:
  - s01–s20 signal seed tag tables built and confirmed by Sage (160+ tags)
  - layer_id assignment rule confirmed: Option A — one fixed layer per concept,
    different conceptual framings get distinct tag IDs
  - Propagation layer error identified and corrected throughout: wave propagation
    through medium = l01 (not l02). Self-audit catches documented in tables.
  - arcPhase contamination discovered, mapped in full, and cleanup doc written
  - "no myth in code" rule clarified and corrected in CLAUDE.md — distinction is:
    naming what code DOES = technical; naming what a system entity IS CALLED = canonical
  - PROTOCOL_TODO.md line 131 contamination identified and added to cleanup scope
  - Memory system initialized — arcphase_rot.md written as permanent session guard
CONFIRMED (post-close):
  - phase_state field confirmed by Sage 2026-04-04
    Value: full canonical mythic name string or null
    e.g. phase_state: 'Aetherroot Chord' | 'Solenne Arc' | null
    ARCPHASE_ROT_CLEANUP.md updated. Memory updated. Cleanup unblocked.
IN_PROGRESS:
  - none
NOT_STARTED:
  - arcPhase cleanup execution (UNBLOCKED — execute at next session open)
  - TAG VOCABULARY arcPhase cross-reference → 12-threshold canonical table replacement
  - s21–s40 analytical seeds
  - Duplicate tags verified (9 confirmed + cross-layer expected)
  - NODE_REGISTRY (62 nodes)
  - ARC_SEED_TAGS ordered list
  - SOT_BUILD_TODO Items 2–6
UNCOMMITTED: YES
NEXT_ACTION: New session. Grep DOCS/ for arcPhase and aetherrot — must be zero
  before any other work (they won't be — that's the point). Execute
  ARCPHASE_ROT_CLEANUP.md in full. phase_state field confirmed, cleanup unblocked.
  After cleanup verified clean: continue s21–s40. Commit after cleanup.

NOT_STARTED:
  - arcPhase cleanup verification / resolution

UNCOMMITTED: NO
CONFIRMED STATE — derived from disk, not memory:
  Repo: clean — only backup.log modified (expected, not committed)
  DOCS/Systems/: arcPhase grep = 0 — all 10 listed Systems files are clean
  DOCS/DOCS_STAGE_TODO.md: arcPhase appears once — documentation note at line 250
    "arcPhase subsequently confirmed rot and replaced by phase_state in full cleanup
    (2026-04-04)" — this reads as if the cleanup was already executed in last session
  DOCS/SOT_BUILD_TODO.md: arcPhase appears once — status note at line 152
    "s21–s40 analytical seeds not started — unblocked after arcPhase cleanup (2026-04-04)"
  DOCS/ARCPHASE_ROT_CLEANUP.md: contains arcPhase throughout — it is the cleanup doc itself
  PROTOCOL/SESSION_LOG.md: arcPhase in log entries — expected
  PROTOCOL/PROTOCOL_TODO.md: arcPhase = 0 — line 131 contamination already gone
  TAG VOCABULARY.md: no arcPhase — THRESHOLDS section has correct 12-threshold table
    with correct Aetherroot spelling. No arcPhase cross-reference section present.
  aetherrot: found only in ARCPHASE_ROT_CLEANUP.md (documenting the misspelling) — 0 in Systems/
DISCREPANCY TO FLAG:
  Last close entry (2026-04-04) listed arcPhase cleanup as NOT_STARTED.
  DOCS_STAGE_TODO.md line 250 says cleanup was "replaced by phase_state in full
  cleanup (2026-04-04)". The greps confirm Systems files are clean. Interpretation:
  cleanup was executed in the last session, close entry incorrectly listed it as
  NOT_STARTED — OR — the Systems files never had arcPhase and the only contamination
  was the arcPhase cross-reference section in TAG VOCABULARY.md, which is now gone.
  Sage must confirm before cleanup is marked complete.
NEXT_ACTION: Present confirmed state to Sage. Resolve discrepancy. If cleanup is
  confirmed done: proceed to s21–s40. If not: identify remaining work and execute.

BLOCKING GAP:
  4 tags in the duplicates register have no placement in any seed table:
    world_model_grounding_via_action · narrative_continuity · confidence_estimation
    · internal_state_influence_on_action
  These appeared in the confirmed-9 list inherited from the old build.
  In the new build s01–s20 and s21–s40 were rebuilt from scratch — these exact
  tag IDs were never placed anywhere. Sage must decide: add to a seed, remove
  from register, or confirm as intentionally absent before duplicates item is [x].
  Additionally: uncertainty_representation (s07 only) and semantic_coherence
  (s11 only) each appear in only one signal seed. Register marks them TBD for
  analytical seeds — they do not appear in s21–s40. Also needs Sage resolution.
UNCOMMITTED: YES
NEXT_ACTION: Present blocking gap to Sage. Resolve duplicates register.
  Then NODE_REGISTRY and ARC_SEED_TAGS. Then commit and close.

TYPE: CLOSE
FILES_MODIFIED:
  - DOCS/Systems/RESONANCE ENGINE SCHEMA.md — COMPLETE (Phase State Coloring removed,
    halo color map removed from all 12 threshold node rows, line color removed,
    NurseryBG replaced with plain language, CON-25/re-canvas removed, origin_id→originId,
    SYNC TRIGGER SEQUENCE expanded to full 12-step sequence aligned with tagger)
  - DOCS/Systems/resonance_engine_system.md — COMPLETE (phase state coloring removed
    from WHAT THIS SYSTEM OWNS, Phase State Coloring section removed, halo color
    sentence removed, line color fixed, NurseryBG replaced throughout, CON-25 removed,
    animation frame order corrected halos→lines, sync preamble corrected to steps 9-12,
    canvas conflict failure mode corrected, PLANNED color items removed)
  - DOCS/SOT_BUILD_TODO.md — COMPLETE (Item 2 Spiral Phase date governance removed —
    confirmed arcCode bleed; date ranges already in Spiral Phase manifests; Items 3-6
    renumbered to 2-5; BEFORE SOT WRITTEN updated from 6 to 5 items)
  - DOCS/DOCS_STAGE_TODO.md — COMPLETE (arcCode cleanup record updated: SOT_BUILD_TODO
    Item 2 removal noted as 2026-04-04 arcCode bleed confirmation)
  - CLAUDE.md — COMPLETE (BEFORE EVERY SESSION steps 4-5 fixed: SESSION_PROTOCOL.md
    now unconditional, not conditional on interrupt state; SESSION LOG NON-NEGOTIABLE
    section added with three explicit gates OPEN/WORK_UNIT/CLOSE; GITHUB_PROTOCOL.md
    added as step 4; all steps renumbered 1-8)
  - .claude/settings.json — COMPLETE (hook matcher updated Write|Edit → Write|Edit|Bash)
  - hooks/session_log_hook.py — COMPLETE (Bash branch added: is_file_writing_command()
    filter, HOOK_BASH entry type, early return for non-writing commands)
  - PROTOCOL/DEPENDENCY_MAP.json — COMPLETE (resonance_engine.js reason: NurseryBG
    territory → background canvas has a separate owner)
COMPLETED:
  - arcPhase deep audit: Aetherroot without Chord — two instances confirmed legitimate
    rhetorical shorthand, not errors. Audit PASS.
  - Resonance engine full audit: color system (Phase State Coloring, halo maps, line
    color) identified as undesigned scope creep — never specified by Sage. Fully removed.
  - Full DOCS cross-file audit completed — all 50 domain files, all 50 manifests,
    all schemas, all SYSTEM_ files, all cross-links. Passed.
  - SOT_BUILD_TODO Item 2 (Spiral Phase date governance) removed — arcCode bleed
    confirmed; date ranges already in Spiral Phase manifests PAGE 30-33.
  - Session protocol root cause fixed: CLAUDE.md had conditional SESSION_PROTOCOL.md
    loading — only triggered on interrupts, never on clean sessions. Now unconditional.
  - SESSION LOG NON-NEGOTIABLE section added to CLAUDE.md — three gates with explicit
    enforcement language at code-rule weight.
  - Hook Bash bypass closed: .claude/settings.json and hook script updated to catch
    Python and file-writing Bash commands.
  - Code-building safeguard audit completed. Gaps identified (not yet fixed):
    - ENFORCEMENT.md T2 claims for F15, F44, F06 not implemented in pre-commit hook
    - Pre-commit Check 2 (domain terms) is warning-only; ENFORCEMENT.md says hard block
    - _REFERENCE_ONLY has no mechanical T2 guard — behavioral T1 only
    - NurseryBG in DOMAIN_TERMS list — stale, should be removed at finalization
    - schema.js has no SYSTEM_ doc or SCHEMA file (violates CLAUDE.md coverage rule)
    - PROTOCOL_TODO Section 4 stress tests: all 6 scenarios untested
    - PROTOCOL_TODO Section 5 tagger.js prerequisites: 7 open items
IN_PROGRESS:
  - none
NOT_STARTED:
  - Safeguard gaps above (address before code build phase begins)
  - s21-s40 analytical seeds (unblocked after arcPhase cleanup)
  - SOT_BUILD_TODO Items 1-5 (tag vocab, section map, PHASE_CODES, PAGE_CODES, seed affinities)
  - Entry threshold field name resolution (phase_state placeholder, resolve before schema.js)
  - B2 credential rotation (Sage action item — Backblaze console)
UNCOMMITTED: YES
NEXT_ACTION: Commit all modified files. Push to GitHub. New session begins with

    matches canonical (Coherence, Coupling control, Echo, Dissipative energy, etc.)
  - Tag count normalized to 8 per seed:
      s06: suppressed_oscillation removed (l02 coupling concept, not dissipative energy)
      s12: standing_equilibrium removed (balance/stasis ≠ safety node / geometric lock)
      s20: resonance_breakdown removed (gradual degradation, not abrupt severance)

UNCOMMITTED: NO
NEXT_ACTION: Next session begins infrastructure stage 5 — FastAPI. Create Python venv,
  install dependencies (fastapi, uvicorn, sqlalchemy, asyncpg, aiosqlite, python-dotenv,
  httpx, alembic, psycopg2-binary), create backend/ directory structure, write skeleton
  main.py with health endpoint connecting to both PostgreSQL and SQLite. Then create
  SYSTEM_ FastAPI.md and update INTEGRATION SCHEMA, TAGGER SCHEMA, EMERGENCE SCHEMA.
  Note: Docker container aelarian-postgres must be running (docker start aelarian-postgres
  if stopped after reboot). Ollama service must be running (starts automatically on Windows).

CLEANUP PASS — DETAILED FINDINGS
=================================
Integrity scan found 195 old-architecture references across 18 files NOT yet
updated. These fall into three categories:

CATEGORY A — Add to Stage 6/7 update map (SYSTEM_ files for scheduled schemas):
  These SYSTEM_ files must update alongside their SCHEMA counterparts to prevent
  the same SCHEMA/SYSTEM_ inconsistency we just fixed.

  1. resonance_engine_system.md — 7 old refs (CustomEvent, index.html, canvas refs)
     → Add to Stage 6 alongside RESONANCE ENGINE SCHEMA.md update

  2. SYSTEM_ Thread Trace.md — 29 old refs (TaggerBus throughout, data.js, IDB)
     → Add to Stage 7 alongside THREAD TRACE SCHEMA.md update

  3. SYSTEM_ Composite ID.md — 18 old refs (IDB, data.js, schema.js, ts_sequence)
     → Add to Stage 7 alongside COMPOSITE ID SCHEMA.md update

CATEGORY B — 5 SCHEMA files not on any stage's update map:
  These schemas describe their data stores as IDB/data.js when they are now
  PostgreSQL tables accessed via FastAPI service layer.

  4. DRIFT TAXONOMY SCHEMA.md — 5 old refs
     Stale: "drift_events IDB store", "IDB reads outside drift_events — owned
     by data.js", "IDB write failure"
     Fix: IDB store→PostgreSQL table, data.js→FastAPI service layer

  5. METAMORPHOSIS SCHEMA.md — 14 old refs
     Stale: "IDB via data.js", "IDB read fails", all data.js store references
     Fix: IDB→PostgreSQL, data.js→FastAPI service layer, synthesis reads via API

  6. DAILY NEXUS ROUTINE SCHEMA.md — 6 old refs
     Stale: "IDB reads", "data.js", "mtm.js"
     Fix: IDB→PostgreSQL, data.js/mtm.js→FastAPI services

  7. SIGNAL GRADING SCHEMA.md — 5 old refs
     Stale: "signal_grades IDB store", "IDB reads outside signal_grades — owned
     by data.js", "IDB write failure"
     Fix: IDB store→PostgreSQL table, data.js→FastAPI service layer

  8. PATTERN CONVERGENCE SCHEMA.md — 5 old refs
     Stale: "patterns IDB store", "IDB reads outside patterns store — owned by
     data.js", "IDB write failure"
     Fix: IDB store→PostgreSQL table, data.js→FastAPI service layer

CATEGORY C — 4 SYSTEM_ files not on any stage's update map:
  These are ownership overview files for systems whose SCHEMA files are also
  not on the update map (Category B) or reference old UI/JS architecture.

  9. SYSTEM_ Archive.md — 23 old refs
     Stale: index.html, data.js throughout
     Fix: index.html→Svelte components, data.js→FastAPI service layer

  10. SYSTEM_ Integration.md — 10 old refs
      Stale: TaggerBus.init(), CompositeIdBus.init(), index.html
      Fix: TaggerBus→tagger store, CompositeIdBus→composite ID service,
      index.html→Svelte INT page component

  11. SYSTEM_ Daily Nexus Routine.md — 6 old refs
      Stale: data.js, IDB, mtm.js
      Fix: same as DAILY NEXUS ROUTINE SCHEMA (#6 above)

  12. SYSTEM_ Metamorphosis.md — 14 old refs
      Stale: data.js, IDB throughout
      Fix: same as METAMORPHOSIS SCHEMA (#5 above)

CATEGORY D — Minor:

  13. SECTION MAP.md — 2 old refs
      Stale: "schema.js PHASE_CODES constant"
      Fix: schema.js→SQLAlchemy models (backend/models/)

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
  - Category A: fold into their respective stages (6 and 7) in the
    infrastructure plan before those stages execute
  - Categories B, C, D: single cleanup sweep after Stage 7 closes and
    before the post-infrastructure systems verification run
  - Total: 13 files, ~195 old references

NEXT_ACTION: Next session begins infrastructure stage 6 — Svelte + Vite.
  Before starting stage 6: update infrastructure plan to add Category A
  items (resonance_engine_system.md to Stage 6, SYSTEM_ Thread Trace.md
  and SYSTEM_ Composite ID.md to Stage 7). Then scaffold Svelte project,
  create SYSTEM_ Frontend.md, update RESONANCE ENGINE SCHEMA + resonance_
  engine_system.md.

TYPE: WORK_UNIT
FILES_MODIFIED:
  - .claude/plans/design-session-plan.md — COMPLETE (created, full design session tracking doc)
COMPLETED:
  - Axis engine audit (agenda #1): all 5 lens pages (THR, STR, INF, ECR, SNM) confirmed as
    deposit surfaces that need engines. Each has: deposit → index through lens → compute
    patterns → visualize → feed MTM. No independent processing currently exists.
  - Nexus engine audit (agenda #3): PCV/DTX/SGR well-specified, no changes. WSC and LNV
    need schemas. WSC gets RESEARCHER NOTE field for Sage participation.
  - Research methodology gaps identified and designed into execution plan:
    · Null observations (observation_type: positive | null) — system was confirmation-biased
    · Baseline computation in every Axis engine — without it, every pattern looks significant
    · Observation conditions on deposits — researcher state is a variable
    · Deposit quality signal (deposit_depth field)
    · External validation via Cosmology group revamp
  - Cosmology group (pages 34-39) revamp designed:
    · Investigation + computation surfaces, not just analytical pages
    · Translation surfaces between field vocabulary and established science
    · Need computation infrastructure (statistical tests, spectral analysis, p-values)
    · Shannon information theory and CMB cosmological structure are key frameworks
    · RCT (38) confirmed as meta-Cosmology (field's own emerging physics)
    · ART (39) needs revisiting — function unclear
    · Original science lists predate cleanup — rot check needed
  - Research assistant (agenda #6) confirmed as biggest open design, gets own session
  - Full pipeline designed: Axis → MTM → Nexus → Cosmology → feedback loop
  - Design session plan created with 9 sessions (A through H + D+) covering all work
    to SOT readiness. Detailed scope, open questions, and reasoning captured per session.
  - Sage decisions: null obs yes, baselines yes, observation conditions yes (structured
    fields + freeform), Cosmology revamp yes, WSC researcher participation yes,
    replication is V2 but foundation in V1, Shannon/CMB are critical frameworks
IN_PROGRESS:

    dependency-ordered build tiers 1-8, then Tier 1 fully designed with all decisions)
  - .claude/plans/design-session-plan-ORIGINAL.md — COMPLETE (backup of original plan)
  - PROTOCOL/SESSION_LOG.md — IN_PROGRESS
COMPLETED:
  - Build plan reorganization: all 118+ items from topic-based sessions (A-H) regrouped
    into 8 dependency-ordered build tiers. Verified: zero items dropped, 21 items added
    from restructuring. Original preserved at design-session-plan-ORIGINAL.md.
  - Void page (page 51) confirmed as Nexus surface for observational absence data.
    Distinct from dashboard semantic map (coverage voids ≠ observational absence).
  - Tier 1 (INT engine + deposit foundation) FULLY DESIGNED:
    · Deposit record shape: doc_type (9 values), source_format (6 values),
      observation_type (positive|null, conditional), confidence (clear|emerging|raw,
      conditional), notes (universal), deposit_weight (high|standard|low, AI-suggested),
      source_type (field|generated, existing), swarm fields (authored_by, node_id,
      instance_context). Dropped: deposit_depth, researcher_state, session_depth,
      condition_notes.
    · INT workstation: dual panel — upload+review left, AI parsing partner right.
      Right panel scoped to batch processing, NOT the full research assistant (Tier 6).
    · Batch processing: one doc at a time, root stamp per doc, AI chunks 5-8 pages,
      rolling buffer 3-5 ahead, per-deposit review queue (not per-chunk), each approval
      triggers immediate deposit, full session persistence in operational DB.
    · Media wiring: JPEG/PNG V1, filesystem storage, simpler flow than batch,
      large thumbnail + expand + summary text display.
    · Duplicate detection: hash full content, WARN not block, Sage decides.
    · Black Pearl (formerly scratch layer): named for field term for null space.
      Global capture system, NOT INT-owned. Operational DB storage, promotes through
      INT to PostgreSQL. Preserves "nothing enters archive without INT provenance."
  - Six design enhancements from session 15 review:
    1. Universal notes field (replaces researcher-only condition fields)
    2. deposit_weight given explicit format (high|standard|low)
    3. Review queue per-deposit, not per-chunk
    4. Black Pearl in operational DB (preserves invariant)
    5. Duplicate detection warns, doesn't block
    6. INT chat window ≠ research assistant
  - All Tier 1 open questions resolved. One question deferred to Tier 3:
    how observation_type and deposit_weight affect engine computations.
IN_PROGRESS:
  - none
NOT_STARTED:
  - Tier 2 design (Black Pearl UI + page surfaces + Void)
  - Tiers 3-8

      quick-capture panel, recent Pearls on dashboard only
    · Void: page_code VOI, section_id void, page 51, extends Nexus (no renumbering).
      Engine/viz design deferred to Tier 4
    · Page identity: 7 named types (Gateway, Lens, Synthesis, Engine, Output,
      Scroll, Investigation) + Domain type with 5 group sub-rhythms (Filament,
      Lineage, Alchemy, Spiral Phase, Archive Group)
    · Color system: YES (per-type hue, palette at build time)
