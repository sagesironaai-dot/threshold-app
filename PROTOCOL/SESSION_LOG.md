FILES_MODIFIED:
  - CLAUDE.md — COMPLETE ("no myth in code" rule corrected: applies to .js
    function/method names only, not canonical system identifiers or enum values)
  - DOCS/SOT_BUILD_TODO.md — COMPLETE (Item 1 first sub-item marked [~],
    s01–s20 progress noted, s21–s40 blocked on cleanup noted)
  - DOCS/Systems/TAG VOCABULARY.md — CREATED (s01–s20 signal seeds complete,
    160+ tags with full routing, duplicates register, routing reference,
    threshold cross-reference section — CONTAMINATED with arcPhase, needs replacement)
  - DOCS/ARCPHASE_ROT_CLEANUP.md — CREATED (complete cleanup map: 13 infected
    files, 9 aetherroot spelling files, verification greps, open field name
    question, TAG VOCABULARY status at time of writing)
  - memory/arcphase_rot.md — CREATED (permanent memory: arcPhase is rot,
    12 threshold states, aetherroot spelling, grep at every session open)
  - memory/MEMORY.md — CREATED (index initialized with arcphase_rot pointer)
COMPLETED:
  - s01–s20 signal seed tag tables built and confirmed by Sage (160+ tags)
  - layer_id assignment rule confirmed: Option A — one fixed layer per concept,
    different conceptual framings get distinct tag IDs
  - Propagation layer error identified and corrected throughout: wave propagation
    through medium = l01 (not l02). Self-audit catches documented in tables.
  - arcPhase contamination discovered, mapped in full, and cleanup doc written
  - "no myth in code" rule clarified and corrected in CLAUDE.md — distinction is:
    naming what code DOES = technical; naming what a system entity IS CALLED = canonical
  - PROTOCOL_TODO.md line 131 contamination identified and added to cleanup scope
  - Memory system initialized — arcphase_rot.md written as permanent session guard
CONFIRMED (post-close):
  - phase_state field confirmed by Sage 2026-04-04
    Value: full canonical mythic name string or null
    e.g. phase_state: 'Aetherroot Chord' | 'Solenne Arc' | null
    ARCPHASE_ROT_CLEANUP.md updated. Memory updated. Cleanup unblocked.
IN_PROGRESS:
  - none
NOT_STARTED:
  - arcPhase cleanup execution (UNBLOCKED — execute at next session open)
  - TAG VOCABULARY arcPhase cross-reference → 12-threshold canonical table replacement
  - s21–s40 analytical seeds
  - Duplicate tags verified (9 confirmed + cross-layer expected)
  - NODE_REGISTRY (62 nodes)
  - ARC_SEED_TAGS ordered list
  - SOT_BUILD_TODO Items 2–6
UNCOMMITTED: YES
NEXT_ACTION: New session. Grep DOCS/ for arcPhase and aetherrot — must be zero
  before any other work (they won't be — that's the point). Execute
  ARCPHASE_ROT_CLEANUP.md in full. phase_state field confirmed, cleanup unblocked.
  After cleanup verified clean: continue s21–s40. Commit after cleanup.

NOT_STARTED:
  - arcPhase cleanup verification / resolution

UNCOMMITTED: NO
CONFIRMED STATE — derived from disk, not memory:
  Repo: clean — only backup.log modified (expected, not committed)
  DOCS/Systems/: arcPhase grep = 0 — all 10 listed Systems files are clean
  DOCS/DOCS_STAGE_TODO.md: arcPhase appears once — documentation note at line 250
    "arcPhase subsequently confirmed rot and replaced by phase_state in full cleanup
    (2026-04-04)" — this reads as if the cleanup was already executed in last session
  DOCS/SOT_BUILD_TODO.md: arcPhase appears once — status note at line 152
    "s21–s40 analytical seeds not started — unblocked after arcPhase cleanup (2026-04-04)"
  DOCS/ARCPHASE_ROT_CLEANUP.md: contains arcPhase throughout — it is the cleanup doc itself
  PROTOCOL/SESSION_LOG.md: arcPhase in log entries — expected
  PROTOCOL/PROTOCOL_TODO.md: arcPhase = 0 — line 131 contamination already gone
  TAG VOCABULARY.md: no arcPhase — THRESHOLDS section has correct 12-threshold table
    with correct Aetherroot spelling. No arcPhase cross-reference section present.
  aetherrot: found only in ARCPHASE_ROT_CLEANUP.md (documenting the misspelling) — 0 in Systems/
DISCREPANCY TO FLAG:
  Last close entry (2026-04-04) listed arcPhase cleanup as NOT_STARTED.
  DOCS_STAGE_TODO.md line 250 says cleanup was "replaced by phase_state in full
  cleanup (2026-04-04)". The greps confirm Systems files are clean. Interpretation:
  cleanup was executed in the last session, close entry incorrectly listed it as
  NOT_STARTED — OR — the Systems files never had arcPhase and the only contamination
  was the arcPhase cross-reference section in TAG VOCABULARY.md, which is now gone.
  Sage must confirm before cleanup is marked complete.
NEXT_ACTION: Present confirmed state to Sage. Resolve discrepancy. If cleanup is
  confirmed done: proceed to s21–s40. If not: identify remaining work and execute.

BLOCKING GAP:
  4 tags in the duplicates register have no placement in any seed table:
    world_model_grounding_via_action · narrative_continuity · confidence_estimation
    · internal_state_influence_on_action
  These appeared in the confirmed-9 list inherited from the old build.
  In the new build s01–s20 and s21–s40 were rebuilt from scratch — these exact
  tag IDs were never placed anywhere. Sage must decide: add to a seed, remove
  from register, or confirm as intentionally absent before duplicates item is [x].
  Additionally: uncertainty_representation (s07 only) and semantic_coherence
  (s11 only) each appear in only one signal seed. Register marks them TBD for
  analytical seeds — they do not appear in s21–s40. Also needs Sage resolution.
UNCOMMITTED: YES
NEXT_ACTION: Present blocking gap to Sage. Resolve duplicates register.
  Then NODE_REGISTRY and ARC_SEED_TAGS. Then commit and close.

TYPE: CLOSE
FILES_MODIFIED:
  - DOCS/Systems/RESONANCE ENGINE SCHEMA.md — COMPLETE (Phase State Coloring removed,
    halo color map removed from all 12 threshold node rows, line color removed,
    NurseryBG replaced with plain language, CON-25/re-canvas removed, origin_id→originId,
    SYNC TRIGGER SEQUENCE expanded to full 12-step sequence aligned with tagger)
  - DOCS/Systems/resonance_engine_system.md — COMPLETE (phase state coloring removed
    from WHAT THIS SYSTEM OWNS, Phase State Coloring section removed, halo color
    sentence removed, line color fixed, NurseryBG replaced throughout, CON-25 removed,
    animation frame order corrected halos→lines, sync preamble corrected to steps 9-12,
    canvas conflict failure mode corrected, PLANNED color items removed)
  - DOCS/SOT_BUILD_TODO.md — COMPLETE (Item 2 Spiral Phase date governance removed —
    confirmed arcCode bleed; date ranges already in Spiral Phase manifests; Items 3-6
    renumbered to 2-5; BEFORE SOT WRITTEN updated from 6 to 5 items)
  - DOCS/DOCS_STAGE_TODO.md — COMPLETE (arcCode cleanup record updated: SOT_BUILD_TODO
    Item 2 removal noted as 2026-04-04 arcCode bleed confirmation)
  - CLAUDE.md — COMPLETE (BEFORE EVERY SESSION steps 4-5 fixed: SESSION_PROTOCOL.md
    now unconditional, not conditional on interrupt state; SESSION LOG NON-NEGOTIABLE
    section added with three explicit gates OPEN/WORK_UNIT/CLOSE; GITHUB_PROTOCOL.md
    added as step 4; all steps renumbered 1-8)
  - .claude/settings.json — COMPLETE (hook matcher updated Write|Edit → Write|Edit|Bash)
  - hooks/session_log_hook.py — COMPLETE (Bash branch added: is_file_writing_command()
    filter, HOOK_BASH entry type, early return for non-writing commands)
  - PROTOCOL/DEPENDENCY_MAP.json — COMPLETE (resonance_engine.js reason: NurseryBG
    territory → background canvas has a separate owner)
COMPLETED:
  - arcPhase deep audit: Aetherroot without Chord — two instances confirmed legitimate
    rhetorical shorthand, not errors. Audit PASS.
  - Resonance engine full audit: color system (Phase State Coloring, halo maps, line
    color) identified as undesigned scope creep — never specified by Sage. Fully removed.
  - Full DOCS cross-file audit completed — all 50 domain files, all 50 manifests,
    all schemas, all SYSTEM_ files, all cross-links. Passed.
  - SOT_BUILD_TODO Item 2 (Spiral Phase date governance) removed — arcCode bleed
    confirmed; date ranges already in Spiral Phase manifests PAGE 30-33.
  - Session protocol root cause fixed: CLAUDE.md had conditional SESSION_PROTOCOL.md
    loading — only triggered on interrupts, never on clean sessions. Now unconditional.
  - SESSION LOG NON-NEGOTIABLE section added to CLAUDE.md — three gates with explicit
    enforcement language at code-rule weight.
  - Hook Bash bypass closed: .claude/settings.json and hook script updated to catch
    Python and file-writing Bash commands.
  - Code-building safeguard audit completed. Gaps identified (not yet fixed):
    - ENFORCEMENT.md T2 claims for F15, F44, F06 not implemented in pre-commit hook
    - Pre-commit Check 2 (domain terms) is warning-only; ENFORCEMENT.md says hard block
    - _REFERENCE_ONLY has no mechanical T2 guard — behavioral T1 only
    - NurseryBG in DOMAIN_TERMS list — stale, should be removed at finalization
    - schema.js has no SYSTEM_ doc or SCHEMA file (violates CLAUDE.md coverage rule)
    - PROTOCOL_TODO Section 4 stress tests: all 6 scenarios untested
    - PROTOCOL_TODO Section 5 tagger.js prerequisites: 7 open items
IN_PROGRESS:
  - none
NOT_STARTED:
  - Safeguard gaps above (address before code build phase begins)
  - s21-s40 analytical seeds (unblocked after arcPhase cleanup)
  - SOT_BUILD_TODO Items 1-5 (tag vocab, section map, PHASE_CODES, PAGE_CODES, seed affinities)
  - Entry threshold field name resolution (phase_state placeholder, resolve before schema.js)
  - B2 credential rotation (Sage action item — Backblaze console)
UNCOMMITTED: YES
NEXT_ACTION: Commit all modified files. Push to GitHub. New session begins with
