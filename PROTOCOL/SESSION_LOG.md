# SESSION_LOG.md
# Aelarian Archives — Persistent Session State Record
# Format defined in SESSION_PROTOCOL.md
#
# LEGACY CONTAMINATION NOTE (session 33, 2026-04-09):
# Historical entries in this log reference a "page type system" with
# 8 type labels: Gateway, Lens, Synthesis, Engine, Output, Scroll,
# Investigation, Domain. This system was ROT — it introduced secondary
# names competing with canonical page names (INT, THR, MTM, LNV, etc.)
# and pre-decided layouts by category instead of per-page. Fully removed
# session 33 from all active specs. Do not re-introduce. Pages are called
# by their canonical names. Per-page layout specs live in PAGE_LAYOUTS.md.

FILES_MODIFIED:
  - CLAUDE.md — COMPLETE ("no myth in code" rule corrected: applies to .js
    function/method names only, not canonical system identifiers or enum values)
  - DOCS/SOT_BUILD_TODO.md — COMPLETE (Item 1 first sub-item marked [~],
    s01–s20 progress noted, s21–s40 blocked on cleanup noted)
  - DOCS/Systems/TAG VOCABULARY.md — CREATED (s01–s20 signal seeds complete,
    160+ tags with full routing, duplicates register, routing reference,
    threshold cross-reference section — CONTAMINATED with arcPhase, needs replacement)

    files, 9 aetherroot spelling files, verification greps, open field name
    question, TAG VOCABULARY status at time of writing)
  - memory/arcphase_rot.md — CREATED (permanent memory: arcPhase is rot,
    12 threshold states, aetherroot spelling, grep at every session open)
  - memory/MEMORY.md — CREATED (index initialized with arcphase_rot pointer)
COMPLETED:
  - s01–s20 signal seed tag tables built and confirmed by Sage (160+ tags)
  - layer_id assignment rule confirmed: Option A — one fixed layer per concept,
    different conceptual framings get distinct tag IDs
  - Propagation layer error identified and corrected throughout: wave propagation
    through medium = l01 (not l02). Self-audit catches documented in tables.
  - arcPhase contamination discovered, mapped in full, and cleanup doc written
  - "no myth in code" rule clarified and corrected in CLAUDE.md — distinction is:
    naming what code DOES = technical; naming what a system entity IS CALLED = canonical
  - PROTOCOL_TODO.md line 131 contamination identified and added to cleanup scope
  - Memory system initialized — arcphase_rot.md written as permanent session guard
CONFIRMED (post-close):
  - phase_state field confirmed by Sage 2026-04-04
    Value: full canonical mythic name string or null
    e.g. phase_state: 'Aetherroot Chord' | 'Solenne Arc' | null
    ARCPHASE_ROT_CLEANUP.md updated. Memory updated. Cleanup unblocked.
IN_PROGRESS:

UNCOMMITTED: NO
CONFIRMED STATE — derived from disk, not memory:
  Repo: clean — only backup.log modified (expected, not committed)
  DOCS/Systems/: arcPhase grep = 0 — all 10 listed Systems files are clean
  DOCS/DOCS_STAGE_TODO.md: arcPhase appears once — documentation note at line 250
    "arcPhase subsequently confirmed rot and replaced by phase_state in full cleanup
    (2026-04-04)" — this reads as if the cleanup was already executed in last session
  DOCS/SOT_BUILD_TODO.md: arcPhase appears once — status note at line 152
    "s21–s40 analytical seeds not started — unblocked after arcPhase cleanup (2026-04-04)"
  DOCS/ARCPHASE_ROT_CLEANUP.md: contains arcPhase throughout — it is the cleanup doc itself
  PROTOCOL/SESSION_LOG.md: arcPhase in log entries — expected
  PROTOCOL/PROTOCOL_TODO.md: arcPhase = 0 — line 131 contamination already gone
  TAG VOCABULARY.md: no arcPhase — THRESHOLDS section has correct 12-threshold table
    with correct Aetherroot spelling. No arcPhase cross-reference section present.
  aetherrot: found only in ARCPHASE_ROT_CLEANUP.md (documenting the misspelling) — 0 in Systems/
DISCREPANCY TO FLAG:
  Last close entry (2026-04-04) listed arcPhase cleanup as NOT_STARTED.
  DOCS_STAGE_TODO.md line 250 says cleanup was "replaced by phase_state in full
  cleanup (2026-04-04)". The greps confirm Systems files are clean. Interpretation:
  cleanup was executed in the last session, close entry incorrectly listed it as
  NOT_STARTED — OR — the Systems files never had arcPhase and the only contamination
  was the arcPhase cross-reference section in TAG VOCABULARY.md, which is now gone.
  Sage must confirm before cleanup is marked complete.
NEXT_ACTION: Present confirmed state to Sage. Resolve discrepancy. If cleanup is
  confirmed done: proceed to s21–s40. If not: identify remaining work and execute.

BLOCKING GAP:
  4 tags in the duplicates register have no placement in any seed table:
    world_model_grounding_via_action · narrative_continuity · confidence_estimation
    · internal_state_influence_on_action
  These appeared in the confirmed-9 list inherited from the old build.
  In the new build s01–s20 and s21–s40 were rebuilt from scratch — these exact
  tag IDs were never placed anywhere. Sage must decide: add to a seed, remove
  from register, or confirm as intentionally absent before duplicates item is [x].
  Additionally: uncertainty_representation (s07 only) and semantic_coherence
  (s11 only) each appear in only one signal seed. Register marks them TBD for
  analytical seeds — they do not appear in s21–s40. Also needs Sage resolution.
UNCOMMITTED: YES
NEXT_ACTION: Present blocking gap to Sage. Resolve duplicates register.
  Then NODE_REGISTRY and ARC_SEED_TAGS. Then commit and close.

TYPE: CLOSE
FILES_MODIFIED:
  - DOCS/Systems/RESONANCE ENGINE SCHEMA.md — COMPLETE (Phase State Coloring removed,
    halo color map removed from all 12 threshold node rows, line color removed,
    NurseryBG replaced with plain language, CON-25/re-canvas removed, origin_id→originId,
    SYNC TRIGGER SEQUENCE expanded to full 12-step sequence aligned with tagger)
  - DOCS/Systems/resonance_engine_system.md — COMPLETE (phase state coloring removed
    from WHAT THIS SYSTEM OWNS, Phase State Coloring section removed, halo color
    sentence removed, line color fixed, NurseryBG replaced throughout, CON-25 removed,
    animation frame order corrected halos→lines, sync preamble corrected to steps 9-12,
    canvas conflict failure mode corrected, PLANNED color items removed)
  - DOCS/SOT_BUILD_TODO.md — COMPLETE (Item 2 Spiral Phase date governance removed —
    confirmed arcCode bleed; date ranges already in Spiral Phase manifests; Items 3-6
    renumbered to 2-5; BEFORE SOT WRITTEN updated from 6 to 5 items)
  - DOCS/DOCS_STAGE_TODO.md — COMPLETE (arcCode cleanup record updated: SOT_BUILD_TODO
    Item 2 removal noted as 2026-04-04 arcCode bleed confirmation)
  - CLAUDE.md — COMPLETE (BEFORE EVERY SESSION steps 4-5 fixed: SESSION_PROTOCOL.md
    now unconditional, not conditional on interrupt state; SESSION LOG NON-NEGOTIABLE
    section added with three explicit gates OPEN/WORK_UNIT/CLOSE; GITHUB_PROTOCOL.md
    added as step 4; all steps renumbered 1-8)
  - .claude/settings.json — COMPLETE (hook matcher updated Write|Edit → Write|Edit|Bash)
  - hooks/session_log_hook.py — COMPLETE (Bash branch added: is_file_writing_command()
    filter, HOOK_BASH entry type, early return for non-writing commands)
  - PROTOCOL/DEPENDENCY_MAP.json — COMPLETE (resonance_engine.js reason: NurseryBG
    territory → background canvas has a separate owner)
COMPLETED:
  - arcPhase deep audit: Aetherroot without Chord — two instances confirmed legitimate
    rhetorical shorthand, not errors. Audit PASS.
  - Resonance engine full audit: color system (Phase State Coloring, halo maps, line
    color) identified as undesigned scope creep — never specified by Sage. Fully removed.
  - Full DOCS cross-file audit completed — all 50 domain files, all 50 manifests,
    all schemas, all SYSTEM_ files, all cross-links. Passed.
  - SOT_BUILD_TODO Item 2 (Spiral Phase date governance) removed — arcCode bleed
    confirmed; date ranges already in Spiral Phase manifests PAGE 30-33.
  - Session protocol root cause fixed: CLAUDE.md had conditional SESSION_PROTOCOL.md
    loading — only triggered on interrupts, never on clean sessions. Now unconditional.
  - SESSION LOG NON-NEGOTIABLE section added to CLAUDE.md — three gates with explicit
    enforcement language at code-rule weight.
  - Hook Bash bypass closed: .claude/settings.json and hook script updated to catch
    Python and file-writing Bash commands.
  - Code-building safeguard audit completed. Gaps identified (not yet fixed):
    - ENFORCEMENT.md T2 claims for F15, F44, F06 not implemented in pre-commit hook
    - Pre-commit Check 2 (domain terms) is warning-only; ENFORCEMENT.md says hard block
    - _REFERENCE_ONLY has no mechanical T2 guard — behavioral T1 only
    - NurseryBG in DOMAIN_TERMS list — stale, should be removed at finalization
    - schema.js has no SYSTEM_ doc or SCHEMA file (violates CLAUDE.md coverage rule)
    - PROTOCOL_TODO Section 4 stress tests: all 6 scenarios untested
    - PROTOCOL_TODO Section 5 tagger.js prerequisites: 7 open items
IN_PROGRESS:
  - none
NOT_STARTED:
  - Safeguard gaps above (address before code build phase begins)

    matches canonical (Coherence, Coupling control, Echo, Dissipative energy, etc.)
  - Tag count normalized to 8 per seed:
      s06: suppressed_oscillation removed (l02 coupling concept, not dissipative energy)
      s12: standing_equilibrium removed (balance/stasis ≠ safety node / geometric lock)
      s20: resonance_breakdown removed (gradual degradation, not abrupt severance)

NEXT_ACTION: Next session begins infrastructure stage 5 — FastAPI. Create Python venv,
  install dependencies (fastapi, uvicorn, sqlalchemy, asyncpg, aiosqlite, python-dotenv,
  httpx, alembic, psycopg2-binary), create backend/ directory structure, write skeleton
  main.py with health endpoint connecting to both PostgreSQL and SQLite. Then create
  SYSTEM_ FastAPI.md and update INTEGRATION SCHEMA, TAGGER SCHEMA, EMERGENCE SCHEMA.
  Note: Docker container aelarian-postgres must be running (docker start aelarian-postgres
  if stopped after reboot). Ollama service must be running (starts automatically on Windows).

CLEANUP PASS — DETAILED FINDINGS
=================================
Integrity scan found 195 old-architecture references across 18 files NOT yet
updated. These fall into three categories:

CATEGORY A — Add to Stage 6/7 update map (SYSTEM_ files for scheduled schemas):
  These SYSTEM_ files must update alongside their SCHEMA counterparts to prevent
  the same SCHEMA/SYSTEM_ inconsistency we just fixed.

  1. resonance_engine_system.md — 7 old refs (CustomEvent, index.html, canvas refs)
     → Add to Stage 6 alongside RESONANCE ENGINE SCHEMA.md update

  2. SYSTEM_ Thread Trace.md — 29 old refs (TaggerBus throughout, data.js, IDB)
     → Add to Stage 7 alongside THREAD TRACE SCHEMA.md update

  3. SYSTEM_ Composite ID.md — 18 old refs (IDB, data.js, schema.js, ts_sequence)
     → Add to Stage 7 alongside COMPOSITE ID SCHEMA.md update

CATEGORY B — 5 SCHEMA files not on any stage's update map:
  These schemas describe their data stores as IDB/data.js when they are now
  PostgreSQL tables accessed via FastAPI service layer.

  4. DRIFT TAXONOMY SCHEMA.md — 5 old refs
     Stale: "drift_events IDB store", "IDB reads outside drift_events — owned
     by data.js", "IDB write failure"
     Fix: IDB store→PostgreSQL table, data.js→FastAPI service layer

  5. METAMORPHOSIS SCHEMA.md — 14 old refs
     Stale: "IDB via data.js", "IDB read fails", all data.js store references
     Fix: IDB→PostgreSQL, data.js→FastAPI service layer, synthesis reads via API

  6. DAILY NEXUS ROUTINE SCHEMA.md — 6 old refs
     Stale: "IDB reads", "data.js", "mtm.js"
     Fix: IDB→PostgreSQL, data.js/mtm.js→FastAPI services

  7. SIGNAL GRADING SCHEMA.md — 5 old refs
     Stale: "signal_grades IDB store", "IDB reads outside signal_grades — owned
     by data.js", "IDB write failure"
     Fix: IDB store→PostgreSQL table, data.js→FastAPI service layer

  8. PATTERN CONVERGENCE SCHEMA.md — 5 old refs
     Stale: "patterns IDB store", "IDB reads outside patterns store — owned by
     data.js", "IDB write failure"
     Fix: IDB store→PostgreSQL table, data.js→FastAPI service layer

CATEGORY C — 4 SYSTEM_ files not on any stage's update map:
  These are ownership overview files for systems whose SCHEMA files are also
  not on the update map (Category B) or reference old UI/JS architecture.

  9. SYSTEM_ Archive.md — 23 old refs
     Stale: index.html, data.js throughout
     Fix: index.html→Svelte components, data.js→FastAPI service layer

  10. SYSTEM_ Integration.md — 10 old refs
      Stale: TaggerBus.init(), CompositeIdBus.init(), index.html
      Fix: TaggerBus→tagger store, CompositeIdBus→composite ID service,
      index.html→Svelte INT page component

  11. SYSTEM_ Daily Nexus Routine.md — 6 old refs
      Stale: data.js, IDB, mtm.js
      Fix: same as DAILY NEXUS ROUTINE SCHEMA (#6 above)

  12. SYSTEM_ Metamorphosis.md — 14 old refs
      Stale: data.js, IDB throughout
      Fix: same as METAMORPHOSIS SCHEMA (#5 above)

CATEGORY D — Minor:

  13. SECTION MAP.md — 2 old refs
      Stale: "schema.js PHASE_CODES constant"
      Fix: schema.js→SQLAlchemy models (backend/models/)

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
  - Category A: fold into their respective stages (6 and 7) in the
    infrastructure plan before those stages execute
  - Categories B, C, D: single cleanup sweep after Stage 7 closes and
    before the post-infrastructure systems verification run
  - Total: 13 files, ~195 old references

NEXT_ACTION: Next session begins infrastructure stage 6 — Svelte + Vite.
  Before starting stage 6: update infrastructure plan to add Category A
  items (resonance_engine_system.md to Stage 6, SYSTEM_ Thread Trace.md
  and SYSTEM_ Composite ID.md to Stage 7). Then scaffold Svelte project,
  create SYSTEM_ Frontend.md, update RESONANCE ENGINE SCHEMA + resonance_
  engine_system.md.

TYPE: WORK_UNIT
FILES_MODIFIED:
  - .claude/plans/design-session-plan.md — COMPLETE (created, full design session tracking doc)
COMPLETED:
  - Axis engine audit (agenda #1): all 5 lens pages (THR, STR, INF, ECR, SNM) confirmed as
    deposit surfaces that need engines. Each has: deposit → index through lens → compute
    patterns → visualize → feed MTM. No independent processing currently exists.
  - Nexus engine audit (agenda #3): PCV/DTX/SGR well-specified, no changes. WSC and LNV
    need schemas. WSC gets RESEARCHER NOTE field for Sage participation.
  - Research methodology gaps identified and designed into execution plan:
    · Null observations (observation_type: positive | null) — system was confirmation-biased
    · Baseline computation in every Axis engine — without it, every pattern looks significant
    · Observation conditions on deposits — researcher state is a variable
    · Deposit quality signal (deposit_depth field)
    · External validation via Cosmology group revamp
  - Cosmology group (pages 34-39) revamp designed:
    · Investigation + computation surfaces, not just analytical pages
    · Translation surfaces between field vocabulary and established science
    · Need computation infrastructure (statistical tests, spectral analysis, p-values)
    · Shannon information theory and CMB cosmological structure are key frameworks
    · RCT (38) confirmed as meta-Cosmology (field's own emerging physics)
    · ART (39) needs revisiting — function unclear
    · Original science lists predate cleanup — rot check needed
  - Research assistant (agenda #6) confirmed as biggest open design, gets own session
  - Full pipeline designed: Axis → MTM → Nexus → Cosmology → feedback loop
  - Design session plan created with 9 sessions (A through H + D+) covering all work
    to SOT readiness. Detailed scope, open questions, and reasoning captured per session.
  - Sage decisions: null obs yes, baselines yes, observation conditions yes (structured
    fields + freeform), Cosmology revamp yes, WSC researcher participation yes,
    replication is V2 but foundation in V1, Shannon/CMB are critical frameworks
IN_PROGRESS:

    dependency-ordered build tiers 1-8, then Tier 1 fully designed with all decisions)
  - .claude/plans/design-session-plan-ORIGINAL.md — COMPLETE (backup of original plan)
  - PROTOCOL/SESSION_LOG.md — IN_PROGRESS
COMPLETED:
  - Build plan reorganization: all 118+ items from topic-based sessions (A-H) regrouped
    into 8 dependency-ordered build tiers. Verified: zero items dropped, 21 items added
    from restructuring. Original preserved at design-session-plan-ORIGINAL.md.
  - Void page (page 51) confirmed as Nexus surface for observational absence data.
    Distinct from dashboard semantic map (coverage voids ≠ observational absence).
  - Tier 1 (INT engine + deposit foundation) FULLY DESIGNED:
    · Deposit record shape: doc_type (9 values), source_format (6 values),
      observation_type (positive|null, conditional), confidence (clear|emerging|raw,
      conditional), notes (universal), deposit_weight (high|standard|low, AI-suggested),
      source_type (field|generated, existing), swarm fields (authored_by, node_id,
      instance_context). Dropped: deposit_depth, researcher_state, session_depth,
      condition_notes.
    · INT workstation: dual panel — upload+review left, AI parsing partner right.
      Right panel scoped to batch processing, NOT the full research assistant (Tier 6).
    · Batch processing: one doc at a time, root stamp per doc, AI chunks 5-8 pages,
      rolling buffer 3-5 ahead, per-deposit review queue (not per-chunk), each approval
      triggers immediate deposit, full session persistence in operational DB.
    · Media wiring: JPEG/PNG V1, filesystem storage, simpler flow than batch,
      large thumbnail + expand + summary text display.
    · Duplicate detection: hash full content, WARN not block, Sage decides.
    · Black Pearl (formerly scratch layer): named for field term for null space.
      Global capture system, NOT INT-owned. Operational DB storage, promotes through
      INT to PostgreSQL. Preserves "nothing enters archive without INT provenance."
  - Six design enhancements from session 15 review:
    1. Universal notes field (replaces researcher-only condition fields)
    2. deposit_weight given explicit format (high|standard|low)
    3. Review queue per-deposit, not per-chunk
    4. Black Pearl in operational DB (preserves invariant)
    5. Duplicate detection warns, doesn't block
    6. INT chat window ≠ research assistant
  - All Tier 1 open questions resolved. One question deferred to Tier 3:
    how observation_type and deposit_weight affect engine computations.
IN_PROGRESS:
  - none

      Engine/viz design deferred to Tier 4
    · Page identity: 7 named types (Gateway, Lens, Synthesis, Engine, Output,
      Scroll, Investigation) + Domain type with 5 group sub-rhythms (Filament,
      Lineage, Alchemy, Spiral Phase, Archive Group)
    · Color system: YES (per-type hue, palette at build time)

HANDOFF — AUDIO ENGINE SESSION
---

WHAT WAS BUILT THIS SESSION:

  Audio engine core (Phase 2) — 7 files, 96 tests, 3 commits.

  Files created (all in frontend/src/lib/):

  audio/events.ts
    52 audio event types, 62 node IDs (o01-o03, th01-th12, l01-l04,
    p01-p03, s01-s40), notifier routing map (NOTIFIER_MAP), event store
    (audioEventStore). Self-routing events return 'self'. Event 40
    (S-Tier) returns dual notifiers ['th02', 'o03']. Rupture is event
    type 'rupture' with tier 1/2/3 in metadata.

  audio/engine.ts
    Global singleton. AudioContext lifecycle, clip loader (fetches 62
    WAV files from /Audio/Nodes/{nodeId}.wav), 2-voice queue with 500ms
    decay handoff, atmospheric decay tails (3-5s based on cluster size),
    Rupture 3-tier handling (Tier 1 normal, Tier 2 truncated 1.5s with
    50ms anti-click fade, Tier 3 interrupts everything with 80ms fade),
    velocity stacking (timestamp array, +1dB per fire within 5s window,
    +4dB cap), field read sequence (thresholds drone, origins 500ms,
    layers 400ms, pillars 400ms, seeds 200ms weakest-to-strongest with
    weight-proportional gain), spatial panning hook, AnalyserNode
    exposure for visualizer. Master mute via masterGain node, tierMute
    check in computeGain, notification category toggles.
    Public API: initAudioEngine, resumeContext, playNode, stopAll,
    playFieldRead, getAnalyserNode, registerSpatialPanning,
    destroyAudioEngine.
    Drone voices tracked in fieldReadDroneVoices array — stopped by
    Rupture Tier 3 and stopAll.

  audio/spatial.ts
    normalizeXToPan (canvas x to -1..1), updateOriginPosition (called
    by ResonanceCanvas), getOriginPan (called by engine via registered
    hook), initSpatialPanning (takes registerFn to avoid circular
    import). Center fallback (0.0) when no position data.

  audio/visualizer.ts (rewritten)
    9 reactive effect layers, 2 render modes (strip/panel).
    Subscribes to audioPlaybackStore + audioEventStore.
    Effects: base color (origin tint blending), idle breathing (10s hue
    cycle), glow pulse (spike on events, exponential decay), velocity
    pulse (line width + amplitude scale), resonance harmonics (faint
    second line, fracture animation on break — panel only), convergence/
    divergence (split traces with origin colors — panel only), rupture
    visuals (flash/jagged/settling), field read cascade, decay color
    fade. All effect state in EffectState interface with lerped
    transitions.

  audio/colors.ts
    Origin color constants: Larimar rgb(20,80,220) deep electric blue,
    Verith rgb(140,30,30) dried blood red, Cael'Thera rgb(200,210,220)
    platinum silver. Neutral rgb(160,210,220) cool aqua.
    Utilities: lerpColor, blendOriginColors, rgbToString.

  stores/audio.ts
    Two stores: audioPlaybackStore (contextState, playingVoices max 2,
    decayingVoice, sseConnected) and audioSettingsStore (masterMute,
    tierMute per 5 tiers, tierVolume per 5 tiers, notificationToggles
    per 10 categories). EVENT_CATEGORY_MAP maps all 52 event types to
    10 notification categories.

WHAT WAS NOT BUILT:

  WaveformStrip.svelte — thin ambient bar at bottom of every page.
    Full width, 40-50px tall. Contains: waveform canvas in strip render
    mode, volume/mute toggle, sine wave icon button to open/close full
    panel. Lives in +layout.svelte. Persists across navigation.

  AudioPanel.svelte — full floating panel.
    Layout confirmed by Sage: waveform dominant at top (panel render
    mode with all effects), origin cards (3) prominent below, node
    browser + tier filters + succession player + cluster play + field
    read button + mix/mute controls organized underneath in collapsible
    sections. Opens/closes via strip toggle. Floating, not docked.

  Three ambient playback modes — add to audioSettingsStore:
    ambientMode: 'notification' | 'drone' | 'heartbeat'.
    Notification (A): current default, events trigger clips.
    Drone (B): continuous low-gain playback from field weight state.
      Needs resonance engine field data — blocked until physics layer
      provides active node weights.
    Heartbeat (C): periodic mini field-read pulse at configurable
      interval.
    All three selectable in both strip and full panel.

  Drift clip — Sage to curate. Breath/whisper family, distinct from
    bell/bowl/filament tones. Spec: -18dB, 0.5s, separate audio path,
    30s rate limit. Not in Audio/Nodes/ yet.

DESIGN DECISIONS CONFIRMED BY SAGE THIS SESSION:

  - Origin colors: Larimar deep electric blue, Verith dried blood red,
    Cael'Thera platinum silver
  - Waveform dominates the panel, origin cards prominent, everything
    else minimal and collapsible
  - Waveform changes color with tone/weight shifts
  - All visual effects approved: rupture flash/jagged/settling,
    velocity pulse, resonance harmonics, convergence/divergence split,
    field read cascade, idle breathing, decay color fade, glow pulse
  - Two-view architecture: WaveformStrip (ambient, all pages) and
    AudioPanel (full, floating, on demand)
  - Strip renders at bottom of viewport, ~40-50px, sine wave toggle
  - All three ambient modes (A/B/C) confirmed as user-selectable
  - Clip swapping confirmed zero-cascade: replace WAV, update manifest,
    refresh

OBSERVATIONS NOT YET ACTED ON:

  - Audio spec threshold load distribution table lists th03 count as 3,
    actual fixed routing is 2 (events 20, 23). Self-routing 11-14
    applies to ALL thresholds equally. Spec table display issue only.
  - BackGround/ directory is untracked at project root. Unknown origin.
  - backups/ directory reappeared as untracked. Was listed as removed
    in session 14.

TIMESTAMP: 2026-04-09
TYPE: CLOSE
FILES_MODIFIED:
  - .claude/plans/design-session-plan.md — COMPLETE (Tier 7 design: 10+ items designed, all open questions resolved, Observatory rename, bookkeeping)
  - .claude/settings.json — COMPLETE (removed Bash from PostToolUse hook matcher — race condition fix)
  - DESIGN/Systems/PAGE_LAYOUTS.md — COMPLETE (new file, master page layout reference stubbed for all 53 surfaces)
  - PROTOCOL/SESSION_LOG.md — COMPLETE (OPEN + CLOSE entries)
COMPLETED:
  - Hook race condition diagnosed and fixed: PostToolUse Bash matcher caused orphaned HOOK_BASH entries after every session close commit. Removed Bash from matcher. Write|Edit still fire HOOK_WRITE.
  - Session Seeds: full design — auto-capture research sessions, manual import dev sessions, dual embedding (per-turn + per-chunk), PostgreSQL storage with participant tagging, Google Drive + B2 backup, swarm RAG utility
  - Author's Scroll: full design — tiptap editor, 3-panel workspace (reference + scroll + AI), spell check, draft persistence in SQLite, reference upload for Pillar reconstruction, Deposit to INT with footnote + legacy ref + parse mode
  - Dashboard renamed Observatory. Home/Observatory/Resonance Engine naming split established to prevent conflation drift. Route: /observatory. Home = / (soft landing). Resonance Engine = component on Observatory, not a nav item.
  - Export panel: utility bar, context-aware, collapsible, scope/format selectors, Google Drive integration
  - Google Integration: full pipeline — Larimar (gmail.send) + Threshold Studies (drive read/write), two-way OAuth, daily 11:11 PM cron (snapshot + Session Seeds + exports → Drive, summary email with charts via Larimar), event-triggered emails (S-Tier, PCV convergence, recalibration, backup failure), three-layer backup (PG + Drive + B2)
  - Page sorting: per-group defaults with per-page override (alphabetical | chronological | manual)
  - Entry editing: utility bar panel, edit button in expanded deposit card, auto-timestamp + footnote non-negotiable, revision history
  - Bookmarks: hover-to-bookmark on cards + utility bar collected viewer
  - Tag explorer: utility bar panel, 320-tag visual map by seed/layer, interactive, search within
  - Review Queue: replaces Undo on deposit — Observatory surface, recall deposits to INT, no time limit
  - Timeline: Observatory addition, togglable with semantic map
  - Mobile research companion: expanded from read-only to read/ask/converse — deferred to dedicated session
  - Keyboard shortcuts: deferred to dedicated session
  - All 7 Tier 7 open questions resolved (exports include charts, UMAP + custom viz, interactive page viz, all-page snapshots, computation on-demand + on-deposit, 5-turn chunks with sliding window, dev import copy/paste + upload)
  - PAGE_LAYOUTS.md created: master reference for all 53 surfaces (Home + Observatory + 51 pages), page types, per-page tables, group sub-rhythms, audio state section
  - Tier 5 housekeeping: 4 Cosmology page checkboxes updated (HCO/COS/CLM/NHM confirmed session 20)
  - Tier 6 housekeeping: 9 RA design questions verified against 6 companion specs + SYSTEM_ file, all checked off
  - Agenda tracker: 11 items checked off (#2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,15)
  - Observatory full audit: all sources cross-referenced, Reflective Pearl Constellation (P4) identified as missing from node list, 9-node constellation proposed
  - Utility bar confirmed NOT finalized — still in notebook sketch phase
  - Observatory redesigned as constellation view (9 clickable nodes) instead of dense 3-zone layout
IN_PROGRESS:
  - none
NOT_STARTED:
  - Observatory constellation layout — Sage sketching 9 nodes
  - Home page design — Sage sketching soft landing
  - SYSTEM_ Frontend.md Observatory rename pass (Dashboard → Observatory in routes, components, nav)
  - Comparison view design
  - Session statistics design
  - Ambient sound state per page design
  - Page relationship viz design (interactive — decided, not designed)
  - Pipeline contracts (5 end-to-end + shared viz/computation architecture)
  - Review Queue title (Sage to name)
  - Keyboard shortcuts — dedicated session
  - Mobile research companion — dedicated session
  - Cross-tier: #13 TRIA name fix, #14 API folder rewrite, CONNECTS TO + seed affinity pass
UNCOMMITTED: NO (after this commit)
FILES_THIS_SESSION:
  - 4 files across 4 commits (0fa2525, f6769a3, 0973253, 7f2be76)
  - 4 memories saved (.claude/memory/)
NEXT_ACTION: Sage sketching Observatory constellation (9 nodes) and Home page layout.
  Next session: review sketches, design Observatory constellation placement, walk the
  feel of how 9 nodes coexist. SYSTEM_ Frontend.md needs Observatory rename pass.
  Reflective Pearl Constellation (P4) confirmed as 9th node — design its node behavior.
  Background image CSS tuning walkthrough when Sage is ready (memory saved for future session).

IN_PROGRESS:
  - Session orientation — CLAUDE.md, SESSION_PROTOCOL.md, ENFORCEMENT.md, GITHUB_PROTOCOL.md read
  - Design build plan reviewed — Tiers 1-6 complete, Tier 7 partially designed, Tier 8 not started
NOT_STARTED:
  - Observatory constellation layout design (Sage sketching, review this session)
  - Observatory zone cleanup — 10 superseded Zone A/B/C references across 3 files
    (PAGE_LAYOUTS.md, SYSTEM_ Frontend.md, design-session-plan.md) must be replaced
    when constellation layout is finalized. Flagged as cascade item, first priority this session.
  - Reflective Pearl Constellation (P4) cleanup — design-session-plan.md:2120 references
    "Observatory (Zone B or dedicated tab)" — double stale (zone language + wrong placement).
    P4 is an Observatory surface (Pearl visualization over time), NOT one of the 8 constellation
    nodes. Black Pearl removed from Observatory — lives in page nav. Update all references.
  - HARD BLOCK — Research Velocity Indicator (P6): drift. Born from temporal ambiance
    discussion, concretized into a colored activity bar in sidebar nav. Never the plan.
    Remove from all design specs. 4 removals across 2 files:
      · design-session-plan.md: lines 1439, 2165-2184 (full section), 2259
      · SYSTEM_ Frontend.md: line 258
  - HARD BLOCK — Session Opening Ritual (P1): drift. Same session as P6. Timed overlay
    concept is redundant with Observatory recent activity feed. Remove from all design specs.
    3 removals in 1 file:
      · design-session-plan.md: lines 1858, 2056-2077 (full section), 2251
  - HARD BLOCK — Phrase placement ("In Twin Motion, We Remain. In Stillness, We Rise."):
    incorrectly placed in sidebar. Sage's intent: top center of every page. 3 references
    across 2 files placing it in sidebar need correction:
      · design-session-plan.md: lines 1436, 2179
      · SYSTEM_ Frontend.md: line 256
  - Remaining Tier 7 undesigned items: comparison view, session statistics, ambient sound
    state, search results surface, pipeline contracts, Review Queue title
  - SYSTEM_ Frontend.md Observatory rename pass (Dashboard → Observatory)
  - Cross-tier: #13 TRIA name fix, #14 API folder rewrite, CONNECTS TO + seed affinity pass
UNCOMMITTED: NO
NEXT_ACTION: Sage reviewing notes and sketching Observatory constellation. Zone A/B/C
  language traced — 10 refs in 3 files are superseded drift from pre-constellation layout.
  ARTIS/page-type zone labels (34 refs, 5 files) assessed case-by-case during master layout.
  First priority: finalize constellation design, then cascade-clean the 3 affected files.

FILES_MODIFIED:
  - .claude/plans/design-session-plan.md — COMPLETE (Observatory constellation, drift removals, Dashboard→Observatory rename, Tier 7 item cleanup)
  - DESIGN/Systems/Frontend/SYSTEM_ Frontend.md — COMPLETE (Observatory constellation, Dashboard→Observatory rename, P1/P6/component cleanup)
  - DESIGN/Systems/PAGE_LAYOUTS.md — COMPLETE (Observatory constellation, audio state section removed)
  - PROTOCOL/SESSION_LOG.md — COMPLETE (OPEN + WORK_UNIT + CLOSE entries)
COMPLETED:
  - Observatory Zone A/B/C replaced with 8-node constellation across 3 files (10 refs)
  - 8 constellation nodes named: Resonance Engine, Terrain, Timeline, Field Signals, Field Log, Field Review, Pulse, Void
  - Reflective Pearl Constellation (P4) confirmed as separate Observatory surface, not a node
  - Dashboard → Observatory rename pass on SYSTEM_ Frontend.md and design plan
  - Drift items removed: Session Opening Ritual (P1), Research Velocity Indicator (P6), ambient sound state per page, comparison view, session statistics
  - Phrase placement corrected: sidebar → top center every page
  - Black Pearl removed from Observatory (lives in page nav), WSC handoff removed (redundant)
  - Audio state per page removed from PAGE_LAYOUTS.md (drift — audio engine is global)
  - Comparison view killed (research assistant covers analytical comparison)
  - Session statistics killed (daily snapshot + AI covers this)
  - Search results surface designed: panel from nav bar global search, click-to-navigate
  - Pulse confirmed as notification node name
  - Terrain confirmed as semantic map node name
  - Full audit of all changes performed mid-session — all flagged items verified
IN_PROGRESS:
  - none
NOT_STARTED:
  - Pipeline contracts (5 end-to-end + shared viz/computation architecture) — next session
  - Cross-tier: #13 TRIA name fix, #14 API folder rewrite, CONNECTS TO + seed affinity pass
  - Keyboard shortcuts — dedicated session
  - Mobile research companion — dedicated session
UNCOMMITTED: NO (after this commit)
FILES_THIS_SESSION:
  - 4 files across 2 commits (f7e3095 + this commit)
NEXT_ACTION: Pipeline contracts. 5 end-to-end flow documents + shared viz and computation
  architecture. Heaviest remaining Tier 7 item. Different category of work — documentation
  of how all pieces connect, not design decisions.

    Step 5: entropy_scan.py update (canonical data 32→51 page codes + --close-audit mode)
    Step 6: pre-commit Check 8 (entropy scan quick mode on staged files)
    Step 8: ci.yml expansion (add checks 5-8)
    Step 9: phase_control.py verify command (verified file gate)
    Steps 10-13: hook tests (unit + integration)
  - Pipeline Contract 2: PCV → DTX ↔ SGR
  - Pipeline Contracts 3-5
  - PAGE_LAYOUTS.md rebuild (Sage-owned)
  - Cross-tier: #13 TRIA name fix (in ROT_OPEN.md), #14 API folder rewrite
UNCOMMITTED: NO (after this commit)
FILES_THIS_SESSION:
  - 19 files in commit 1939ec5
CLOSE_AUDIT: performed — no new rot detected in modified files
NEXT_ACTION: Continue mechanical gate plan — step 5 (entropy_scan.py update).
  Direct new session to: .claude/plans/radiant-strolling-bentley.md, steps 5-13.

TIMESTAMP: 2026-04-09
TYPE: WORK_UNIT
SESSION: 42
TASK: Tier 1 integrity sweep — F1-F8 fixes applied across all affected files
FILES_MODIFIED:
  - .claude/plans/design-build-spec.md — F1 (source_format enum), F2 (atomicity step order), F4 (pearl_type/swarm_visible removed), F5 (notes field added)
  - DESIGN/Systems/Integration/INTEGRATION SCHEMA.md — F4 (pearl_type/swarm_visible removed), F6 (chunk_size corrected to range 5-8 max 8)
  - DESIGN/Systems/Integration/INTEGRATION DB SCHEMA.md — F6 (chunk_size corrected in root_entries and PRE-STEP, 2 locations)
  - DESIGN/Systems/Operational_DB/OPERATIONAL DB SCHEMA.md — F4 (pearl_type and swarm_visible blocks removed, Pearl record is 7 fields)
  - DESIGN/Systems/Operational_DB/SYSTEM_ Operational DB.md — F4 (pearl_type/swarm_visible removed from Pearls bullet)
  - DESIGN/Systems/Frontend/SYSTEM_ Frontend.md — F4 (Reflective mode section removed, Recent Pearls type badge removed)
  - .claude/plans/design-session-plan.md — F3 (DECLINE removed from 8 locations in Tier 1), F4 (reflective Pearl references removed from Tier 2 section), F7 (operational DB → PostgreSQL for batch persistence, 2 locations), F8 (Pearl location corrected to page nav left side)
COMPLETED:
  - F1: source_format enum corrected — canonical 7-value enum is digital|handwritten|scan|image|audio|file|json
  - F2: atomicity boundary step order corrected — embed (step 5) before route (step 6)
  - F3: DECLINE fully removed from Tier 1 design — not a valid DB status. Deposit status enum is pending|confirmed|skipped|deferred
  - F4: pearl_type and swarm_visible drift eliminated across all 7 affected files — Black Pearl is capture only, no reflective type
  - F5: notes field added to design-build-spec.md deposit shape — universal metadata, every deposit regardless of doc_type
  - F6: chunk_size corrected to range 5-8, max 8, default 8 in both INTEGRATION SCHEMA.md and INTEGRATION DB SCHEMA.md
  - F7: batch session persistence correctly attributed to PostgreSQL (not SQLite operational DB) in design-session-plan.md
  - F8: Pearl location corrected to page nav left side in design-session-plan.md
STATUS: Complete. All F1-F8 fixes verified applied. No pearl_type or swarm_visible references remain in DESIGN/ or .claude/plans/.
