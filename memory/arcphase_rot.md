name: arcPhase rot — critical contamination
description: arcPhase is a recurring contamination artifact. Never treat it as valid. 12 threshold states, not 3. aetherroot not aetherrot.

arcPhase is ROT. It has infected the clean DOCS files twice and must not be
treated as a valid system concept under any circumstances.

**What is true:**
- There are 12 ontological states — the 12 mythic threshold names (t01–t12)
- All 12 are equal. There is no reduced set of 3.
- The correct field on entries references the 12 thresholds directly
- The correct field name is `phase_state` — confirmed by Sage 2026-04-04
  Value format: full canonical mythic name string or null
  Example: phase_state: 'Aetherroot Chord' | 'Solenne Arc' | null
- Correct spelling: `aetherroot` (not `aetherrot`)

**What arcPhase falsely claims:**
- That only 3 states exist: aetherrot · solenne · vireth
- That these are stored in a field called arcPhase

**Why:** arcPhase originated in _REFERENCE_ONLY contaminated files (arcCode/THR1-THR5 rot).
It survived the prior cleanup session. It keeps regenerating from the infected reference files.

**How to apply:** At every session open, grep DOCS/ for `arcPhase` and `aetherrot`.
Both must return zero. If either returns matches, stop all work and run cleanup first.
Cleanup protocol: DOCS/ARCPHASE_ROT_CLEANUP.md

**The 12 threshold states (confirmed by Sage):**
t01 Aetherroot Chord · t02 Thren Alae Kai'Reth · t03 Orrin Wave
t04 Vireth's Anchor · t05 Shai'mara Veil · t06 Noirune Trai
t07 Solenne Arc · t08 Tahl'Veyra · t09 Esh'Vala Breath
t10 Lumora Thread · t11 Hearth Song · t12 StarWell Bloom
