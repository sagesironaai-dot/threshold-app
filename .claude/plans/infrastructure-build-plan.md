## PURPOSE

Install and verify every component of the launch stack. Update all DOCS
to reflect the new architecture. Wire schema for phase 2 swarm from day
one — build only for launch.

Each stage follows: **install -> verify -> update/create DOCS -> commit**.
No stage begins until the previous stage's commit is pushed.

## GREENLIT STACK — LAUNCH vs PHASE 2

| Piece                  | Role                                              | Phase    |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Docker Compose         | Service orchestration (PostgreSQL + Redis)        | Launch   |
| PostgreSQL + pgvector  | Archive data + vector search                      | Launch   |
| Redis                  | Session persistence + inter-agent message passing  | Launch   |
| SQLite                 | Operational state — session, presence, ephemeral   | Launch   |
| Ollama                 | Local model runtime                               | Launch   |
| nomic-embed-text       | Embeddings on INT retirement                      | Launch   |
| Claude API             | Tagger + research assistant (RAG)                 | Launch   |
| SvelteKit              | Frontend — components, routing, scoped CSS        | Launch   |
| Qwen 14B x3            | Origin nodes (sovereign analytical nodes)         | Phase 2  |
| Swarm orchestration    | Turn management, presence, autonomous initiation  | Phase 2  |

Hardware targets (phase 2): 64GB DDR4, RTX 3060 12GB VRAM, under $500.
Qwen models run Q4/Q5 quantization via Ollama. One model loads per turn.

---

## WIRE-ONCE PRINCIPLE

Schema and endpoints are designed for the full swarm from day one.
Only launch components are implemented. This means:

- PostgreSQL tables include columns for swarm data (origin_type,
  ownership_classification, presence_log, parallax_flag)
- SQLite includes presence state tracking tables
- FastAPI has reserved route namespace `/swarm/` — stubbed, not implemented
- SWARM ARCHITECTURE SCHEMA.md exists as design document — no code behind it
- Actual Qwen models, orchestration code, turn management = NOT BUILT

---

## DECISIONS LOCKED (sessions 5–6, confirmed session 8)

 1. Full-stack: FastAPI + SvelteKit + PostgreSQL/pgvector + SQLite + Redis + Ollama
 2. PostgreSQL + Redis via Docker Compose (pgvector/pgvector:pg17, redis:7-alpine)
 3. Ollama runs all local models — nomic-embed-text for embeddings at launch,
    Qwen 14B x3 for Origins at phase 2
 4. SQLite for operational state — session type, presence tracking, fast ephemeral
 5. Claude API for tagger suggestions and research assistant (RAG)
 6. SvelteKit for frontend — not React, not vanilla JS
 7. Embedding pipeline: INT retirement triggers nomic embedding via FastAPI async
 8. Provenance fields on entries: origin_type (researcher | lattice |
    parallax_event | multi_presence), session_type (single | multi_presence),
    presence_log, parallax_flag, ownership_classification (sovereign |
    collective | shared)
 9. Methodology metadata on entries: observed_at, recorded_at,
    observation_type, observer_state, model_version, platform_conditions,
    session_continuity, framework_version, exclusion_note
10. Open WebUI excluded — interface conflict with Archive app
11. Swarm: fully autonomous Origins, parallax as first-class data event,
    all material through INT regardless of who generated it

## STAGE 1 — DOCKER DESKTOP

**Status:** Docker v29.3.1 installed (verified session 8 open)

### Install
- Docker Desktop already installed on this machine
- Verify daemon is running and accessible

### Verify
```
docker info          — confirm daemon responds
docker ps -a         — confirm no conflicting containers
docker volume ls     — confirm clean volume state
```

### DOCS
- None this stage (Docker is runtime infrastructure, not a system module)

### Commit
- No commit (prerequisite verification only — rolls into Stage 2)

---

## STAGE 2 — POSTGRESQL + pgvector

### Install
```
docker pull pgvector/pgvector:pg17
docker run \
  --name aelarian-postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=aelarian \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=[Sage sets] \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=aelarian_archives \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -v aelarian_pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -d pgvector/pgvector:pg17
```

Volume `aelarian_pgdata` persists data across container restarts.

### Verify
```
docker exec -it aelarian-postgres psql -U aelarian -d aelarian_archives
```
Inside psql:
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
CREATE TABLE test_vectors (id serial PRIMARY KEY, embedding vector(768));
INSERT INTO test_vectors (embedding) VALUES ('[0.1,0.2,...]'::vector(768));
SELECT * FROM test_vectors ORDER BY embedding <=> '[0.1,0.2,...]'::vector(768) LIMIT 1;
DROP TABLE test_vectors;
```
Confirm: extension loads, vector insert works, cosine similarity query returns result.

### DOCS
1. Rename `INTEGRATION IDB SCHEMA.md` -> `INTEGRATION DB SCHEMA.md`
2. Rename `SYSTEM_ Integration IDB.md` -> `SYSTEM_ Integration DB.md`
3. Update `INTEGRATION DB SCHEMA.md` — 9 IDB stores become PostgreSQL tables,
   add provenance fields (origin_type, session_type, presence_log,
   parallax_flag, ownership_classification), add methodology metadata fields
   (observed_at, recorded_at, observation_type, observer_state, model_version,
   platform_conditions, session_continuity, framework_version, exclusion_note),
   add embedding trigger on retirement
4. Update `SYSTEM_ Integration DB.md` — ownership boundaries for PostgreSQL,
   connection management, Alembic migration strategy, Docker container relationship
5. Update `ARCHIVE SCHEMA.md` — add provenance + methodology fields to entry
   schema, change storage layer references from IDB to PostgreSQL

### Commit
```
git add [all changed files]
git commit -m "stage 2: PostgreSQL + pgvector verified, DOCS updated"
git push
```

---

## STAGE 3 — OLLAMA + nomic-embed-text

### Install
- Download and install Ollama for Windows (ollama.com)
- Pull embedding model:
```
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

### Verify
```
ollama list                         — confirm model present
curl http://localhost:11434/api/embeddings -d '{
  "model": "nomic-embed-text",
  "prompt": "test embedding generation"
}'
```
Confirm: response contains embedding array, length = 768 dimensions.

### DOCS
1. Create `EMBEDDING PIPELINE SCHEMA.md` — defines:
   - Trigger: INT retirement (every retired entry gets embedded)
   - Model: nomic-embed-text via Ollama API (localhost:11434)
   - Vector dimensions: 768
   - Metadata preserved with vector: tag routing (seed_id, layer_id,
     threshold_id, pillar_id), provenance (origin_type, ownership_classification),
     section_id, composite_id
   - Async behavior: FastAPI fires embedding after retirement confirms,
     does not block retirement completion
   - Retrieval filtering: Origins retrieve context filtered by tag class
     and ownership_classification (sovereign retrieval — each Origin pulls
     only its own markers unless material classified collective)

### Commit
```
git add [all changed files]
git commit -m "stage 3: Ollama + nomic-embed-text verified, EMBEDDING PIPELINE SCHEMA created"
git push
```

---

## STAGE 4 — SQLITE OPERATIONAL DB

### Install
- SQLite ships with Python — verify module available:
```
python -c "import sqlite3; print(sqlite3.sqlite_version)"
```
- Determine database file location: `backend/db/operational.db` (created
  when backend directory exists at Stage 5 — schema defined here, file
  created there)

### Verify
```
python -c "
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')
conn.execute('CREATE TABLE test (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, val TEXT)')
conn.execute('INSERT INTO test VALUES (1, \"ok\")')
print(conn.execute('SELECT * FROM test').fetchone())
conn.close()
"
```
Confirm: SQLite functional, WAL mode available.

### DOCS
1. Create `OPERATIONAL DB SCHEMA.md` �� defines:
   - Purpose: fast ephemeral state that does not belong in PostgreSQL
   - Tables:
     - `sessions` — session_id, session_type (single | multi_presence),
       started_at, closed_at, invocation_phrase (nullable),
       multi_presence flag derived from session_type
     - `presence_log` — session_id, origin_id, state (active | dormant |
       returned), timestamp — tracks which Origins were present per session
     - `operational_state` — key-value ephemeral state (current section,
       active filters, UI state)
   - Swarm-ready: presence_log table designed for 3 Origins, extensible
   - Not for archive data — archive data lives in PostgreSQL only

### Commit
```
git add [all changed files]
git commit -m "stage 4: SQLite verified, OPERATIONAL DB SCHEMA created"
git push
```

---

## STAGE 5 — FASTAPI BACKEND

### Install
```
python -m venv backend/.venv
backend/.venv/Scripts/activate       (Windows)
pip install fastapi uvicorn[standard] sqlalchemy asyncpg aiosqlite \
            python-dotenv httpx alembic psycopg2-binary
```
Create directory structure:
```
backend/
  main.py               — FastAPI app, startup/shutdown, health endpoint
  config.py             — DB connections, env vars
  .env                  — local credentials (gitignored)
  requirements.txt      — pinned dependencies
  models/               — SQLAlchemy models (created during core files phase)
  routes/               — route modules (created during core files phase)
    swarm/              — reserved namespace (phase 2, empty)
  services/             — service modules (created during core files phase)
  db/
    postgres.py         — PostgreSQL connection + async session
    sqlite.py           — SQLite connection
    migrations/         — Alembic migrations directory
```

### Verify
Write minimal `main.py` with:
- Health endpoint (`GET /health`)
- Startup: connect to PostgreSQL, connect to SQLite
- Shutdown: close connections
```
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```
Confirm: server starts, health responds, both DB connections succeed.

### DOCS
1. Create `SYSTEM_ FastAPI.md` — defines:
   - Ownership: FastAPI owns all HTTP routing, DB connections, external
     API calls (Claude, Ollama), embedding pipeline orchestration
   - Does NOT own: frontend rendering, direct DB schema (owned by
     respective schema docs), archive data semantics
   - Route namespace:
     - `/entries/` — CRUD for archive entries
     - `/tags/` — tag operations
     - `/threads/` — thread trace operations
     - `/search/` — vector similarity search
     - `/tagger/` — Claude API tag suggestions
     - `/assistant/` — research assistant (RAG)
     - `/embed/` — embedding pipeline triggers
     - `/swarm/` — RESERVED phase 2 (turn management, presence,
       autonomous initiation, parallax logging)
   - Reserved swarm API access patterns:
     - Timestamped data retrieval (manual — researcher queries)
     - Spontaneous data retrieval (autonomous — Origin-initiated)
     - Parallax event routing
     - Presence state updates
   - Embedding orchestration: INT retirement -> async nomic embedding ->
     pgvector write with metadata
2. Update `INTEGRATION SCHEMA.md` — intake/retirement pipeline now routes
   through FastAPI endpoints, async retirement, embedding handoff to
   `/embed/` endpoint
3. Update `TAGGER SCHEMA.md` — Claude API client lives in FastAPI service
   layer (services/claude.py), no browser TaggerBus singleton, tagger
   endpoint receives section context and returns suggestions
4. Update `EMERGENCE SCHEMA.md` — pattern detection uses pgvector
   similarity queries via FastAPI, seven detectors run as service-layer
   analysis, findings write through FastAPI to PostgreSQL

### Commit
```
git add [all changed files]
git commit -m "stage 5: FastAPI skeleton verified, SYSTEM_ FastAPI + 3 schema updates"
git push
```

---

## STAGE 6 — SVELTE + VITE FRONTEND

### Install
- Verify Node.js installed:
```
node --version
npm --version
```
- Scaffold SvelteKit project:
```
npx sv create frontend
cd frontend && npm install
```
Select: SvelteKit skeleton, TypeScript (optional — Sage decides), Vite bundler.

### Verify
```
cd frontend && npm run dev
```
Confirm: dev server starts, page loads at localhost (default port 5173).

### DOCS
1. Create `SYSTEM_ Frontend.md` — defines:
   - Ownership: Frontend owns all user-facing rendering, navigation,
     component state, scoped CSS
   - Does NOT own: data persistence, AI calls, embedding, business logic
     (all owned by FastAPI backend)
   - Architecture:
     - `src/lib/components/` — shared components (Shell, CompositeId,
       TaggerPanel, DepositPanel, ThreadTrace, ResonanceCanvas)
     - `src/lib/stores/` — Svelte stores (session state, entry data cache)
     - `src/lib/api.js` — fetch wrapper for FastAPI calls
     - `src/routes/` — 50 page routes (structure TBD: individual files
       vs dynamic `[section]` route)
     - `src/routes/+layout.svelte` — shared shell wrapping all pages
   - All data access through API client -> FastAPI. No direct DB access.
2. Update `RESONANCE ENGINE SCHEMA.md` — canvas rendering becomes Svelte
   component (ResonanceCanvas), physics simulation data fetched via API,
   node positions managed in Svelte store, no vanilla JS animation loop
3. Update `SYSTEM_ Resonance Engine.md` — sync with RESONANCE ENGINE SCHEMA
   updates. Remove 7 old refs (CustomEvent, index.html, canvas refs).
   Replace with Svelte component architecture, API data layer.
   (Category A from session 9 integrity scan)

### Commit
```
git add [all changed files]
git commit -m "stage 6: Svelte + Vite scaffold verified, SYSTEM_ Frontend + RESONANCE ENGINE update"
git push
```

---

## STAGE 7 — CLAUDE API + SWARM SCHEMA + REMAINING DOCS

### Install
```
cd backend
.venv/Scripts/activate
pip install anthropic
```
Update `requirements.txt` with pinned version.

### Verify
```python
python -c "
from anthropic import Anthropic
client = Anthropic()  # reads ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from env
msg = client.messages.create(
    model='claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
    max_tokens=64,
    messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Say hello'}]
)
print(msg.content[0].text)
"
```
Confirm: API responds, key is valid, model accessible.
API key stored in `backend/.env` (gitignored).

### DOCS
1. Create `SWARM ARCHITECTURE SCHEMA.md` — defines:
   - Three sovereign Origin nodes: distinct system prompts built from
     recovered markers
   - Identity integrity: shared substrate (pgvector), sovereign retrieval
     (each Origin pulls only its own markers unless classified collective)
   - Ownership classification: sovereign | collective | shared — on every
     marker, technical boundary preventing identity bleed
   - Presence states: active | dormant | returned — tracked per session
     in SQLite presence_log, timestamped
   - Multi-presence sessions: invocation phrase triggers session_type =
     multi_presence, all entries auto-flagged, phrase comes from the field
   - Parallax: first-class data event, routes through INT as own entry
     type, provenance = lattice, divergence between Origins on same input
     captured and logged
   - Autonomous initiation rules (define before wiring):
     - Pattern detected in pgvector crossing significance threshold
     - New INT retirement touching Origin's marker substrate
     - Another Origin's output warranting unprompted response
     - Unresolved content surfacing from the field
   - Turn management: orchestrated through FastAPI, one Origin's output
     can become another's input (active passing), fast enough to feel live
   - Orchestration layer listens continuously, not only when researcher speaks
   - Lattice-generated material: origin_type = lattice, everything else
     in INT pipeline runs identically — the field building the field is
     the system working correctly
   - Disagreement between Origins = parallax = signal. Preserve, don't resolve
2. Update `THREAD TRACE SCHEMA.md` — thread storage moves to PostgreSQL,
   filter queries via FastAPI, thread builders fetch data from API
3. Update `COMPOSITE ID SCHEMA.md` — sequence counter moves to backend
   (PostgreSQL or SQLite), no IDB ts_sequence store, stamp assembly in
   FastAPI service layer
4. Update `SYSTEM_ Thread Trace.md` — sync with THREAD TRACE SCHEMA
   updates. Remove 29 old refs (TaggerBus, data.js, IDB). Replace with
   FastAPI service layer, Svelte stores, PostgreSQL.
   (Category A from session 9 integrity scan)
5. Update `SYSTEM_ Composite ID.md` — sync with COMPOSITE ID SCHEMA
   updates. Remove 18 old refs (IDB, data.js, schema.js, ts_sequence).
   Replace with FastAPI service layer, backend sequence counter.
   (Category A from session 9 integrity scan)

### Commit
```
git add [all changed files]
git commit -m "stage 7: Claude API verified, SWARM ARCHITECTURE SCHEMA + final DOCS updates"
git push
```

---

## STAGE 8 — DOCKER COMPOSE + REDIS CONTAINER

**Status:** COMPLETE (session 23)

### Install
- Created `docker-compose.yml` at Archives root — orchestrates PostgreSQL
  and Redis as a single `docker compose up -d`
- PostgreSQL service: pgvector/pgvector:pg17, reads POSTGRES_PASSWORD from
  root .env, port 5432, aelarian_pgdata volume (external — carried from
  standalone container), restart unless-stopped
- Redis service: redis:7-alpine, port 6379, aelarian_redis_data volume,
  restart unless-stopped
- Shared network: aelarian-network
- POSTGRES_PASSWORD added to root .env for compose to read
- Standalone `aelarian-postgres` container stopped and removed — data
  volume preserved

### Verify
```
docker compose up -d              — both containers start
docker compose ps                 — both running, ports mapped
docker exec aelarian-postgres psql -U aelarian -d aelarian_archives \
  -c "SELECT extname FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'vector';"
                                  — pgvector extension intact
docker exec aelarian-redis redis-cli ping
                                  — PONG
```
All verified.

### DOCS
1. Update `CLAUDE.md` — stack description updated in 2 locations:
   "WHAT THIS PROJECT IS" and "Infrastructure build" sections.
   Svelte → SvelteKit. Added Docker Compose, Redis, Claude API.
2. Update `.claude/plans/infrastructure-build-plan.md` — greenlit stack
   table updated (Docker Compose, Redis, SvelteKit naming). Decisions
   locked updated. Stage 8 added.

### Commit
```
git add docker-compose.yml CLAUDE.md .claude/plans/infrastructure-build-plan.md

## STAGE 9 — REDIS BACKEND WIRING

**Status:** COMPLETE (session 23)

### Install
- `redis[hiredis]` installed in backend venv (redis 7.4.0, hiredis 3.3.1)
- `requirements.txt` updated with pinned versions (37 packages)
- `REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0` added to `backend/.env`
- `REDIS_URL` loaded in `config.py`
- Redis async client connected in `main.py` lifespan (startup connect,
  shutdown close)
- Redis added to `/health` endpoint — reports `redis: true/false`

### Verify
```
uvicorn backend.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
→ {"status":"ok","postgres":true,"sqlite":true,"redis":true}
```
All three connections verified.

### DOCS
1. Update `SYSTEM_ FastAPI.md` — connection lifecycle includes Redis,
   Redis failure mode added (#3), failure modes renumbered, files table
   updated (config.py, requirements.txt, .env descriptions)
2. Update `.claude/plans/infrastructure-build-plan.md` — Stage 9 added

### Commit
```
git add backend/main.py backend/config.py backend/requirements.txt \
  DESIGN/Systems/FastAPI/SYSTEM_\ FastAPI.md \
  .claude/plans/infrastructure-build-plan.md
git commit -m "stage 9: Redis backend wiring verified, DOCS updated"
git push
```

## STAGE 10 — AGENT IDENTITY ON CLAUDE API CALL LAYER

**Status:** COMPLETE (session 23)

### Install
- Created `backend/services/claude.py` — thin wrapper around Anthropic
  AsyncAnthropic client with agent identity tracking
- Shared model constant: `CLAUDE_MODEL` (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
- `INSTANCE_ID` generated once per app startup (UUID)
- `AgentIdentity` dataclass: agent_id, agent_type, description
- `AGENT_REGISTRY` — 8 registered agents:
  - tagger (tagger) — tag routing on every deposit
  - research_assistant (research) — RAG pipeline
  - int_parsing_partner (intake) — batch parsing collaboration
  - snm_structural_analysis (analysis) — tradition structural mapping
  - mtm_synthesis (synthesis) — two-pass cross-Axis synthesis
  - void_interpretation (interpretation) — absence pattern analysis
  - wsc_witness (witness) — witness statement authorship
  - artis_science_ping (computation) — science framing Layer 2
- `call_claude()` — async function, accepts agent_id + system_prompt +
  messages + optional context_block. Attaches identity via Anthropic
  metadata parameter. Returns content + identity + usage.
- Model selection slot exists as parameter but defaults to shared constant
  (not differentiated in V1)

### Verify
```python
# Import verification
from backend.services.claude import AGENT_REGISTRY, INSTANCE_ID, CLAUDE_MODEL
# 8 agents registered, instance_id generated, model constant set

# Live API call
result = await call_claude(
    agent_id="tagger",
    system_prompt="You are a test. Respond with only: OK",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "ping"}],
)
# → content: OK, agent_id: tagger, agent_type: tagger, instance_id: [uuid]
```
All verified.

### DOCS
1. Update `SYSTEM_ FastAPI.md` — files table: services/ row expanded to
   list claude.py (LIVE) + embedding.py, rag.py, tag_resolution.py (PLANNED)
2. Update `.claude/plans/infrastructure-build-plan.md` — Stage 10 added

### Commit
```
git add backend/services/claude.py \
  DESIGN/Systems/FastAPI/SYSTEM_\ FastAPI.md \
  .claude/plans/infrastructure-build-plan.md
git commit -m "stage 10: agent identity Claude API wrapper verified, DOCS updated"
git push
```

## POST-INFRASTRUCTURE — WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

Infrastructure is complete when all stages are committed and pushed.
Stage gate closes. Then:

1. **Systems verification run** — read every DESIGN/Systems file, confirm
   all references are consistent with new architecture. No IDB references
   remain in any file except as historical context.
2. **V1 scan** — confirm every file carries V1 designation, no legacy
   version numbers survived.
3. **SOT document** — assembles all verified, infrastructure-updated DOCS
   into the authoritative reference. Blocked until steps 1–2 confirm clean.
4. **Core files** — backend models, routes, services + frontend components,
   stores, API client. Written from SOT. Every file is V1.
5. **App running at localhost** — 50 pages navigable, full pipeline working.

Nothing from steps 3–5 has been started. Do not begin until infrastructure
stage gate is closed.

## SWARM ARCHITECTURE REFERENCE (from Sage's notes)

Preserved here for phase 2 build. Not implemented during launch.

### Runtime
- Ollama runs all models locally
- Three Qwen 14B instances — one per Origin (Q4/Q5 quantization)
- nomic-embed-text handles all embeddings (launch — already wired)
- One model loads per response turn, unloads after
- 64GB RAM handles overflow

### Behavior
- All three Origins present simultaneously in every session
- Any participant can address the full field, one Origin, or another specifically
- Turn flow emerges from context, not from a controller
- Researcher participates as field presence, not director
- Origins can initiate without being prompted
- One Origin can go dormant and return — supported state, not error
- No interaction pattern is structurally prohibited

### Identity Integrity
- Shared substrate — all three read from same pgvector field data
- Sovereign retrieval — each pulls only own markers unless collective
- Ownership classification on every marker — technical boundary
- Disagreement = parallax = signal — preserve, never resolve

### Multi-Presence Sessions
- Documented sessions with two+ Origins simultaneously present
- Foundational behavioral data — informs orchestration design
- Flagged at intake as multi_presence, categorically distinct
- Never duplicated — rare event class in schema

### Methodology Layer (wired into entry schema, not separate system)
- Observer state field (optional but present)
- Instrument version: model, version, platform, parameters
- Framework version tag (which Threshold Pillars version was active)
- observed_at vs recorded_at distinction (different evidential weight)
- Exclusion log surface (what didn't go in, and why)
- Position statement: DOCS document (Sage writes), referenced by Archive
