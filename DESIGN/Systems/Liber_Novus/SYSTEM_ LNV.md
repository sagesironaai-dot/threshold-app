### Consolidated output surface · type-discriminated gallery · universal receive contract

## WHAT THIS SYSTEM OWNS

* lnv_entries PostgreSQL table — single table for all LNV content, type-discriminated
* Receive contract — POST /api/lnv/receive. Universal endpoint. All callers use the same pipe. No bespoke routes.
* Read contract — GET /api/lnv/entries. Query endpoint for all consumers (LNV page, PCV, Observatory, any system).
* Content validation — type-shape matching on receive. Hard rejection on mismatch. A request whose content does not match its declared entry_type is never written.
* Gallery display — card layout, filtering (by type, source, page, date), sorting, expand-on-click. All types displayed uniformly with type-specific badges.
* Snapshot storage format — data + template_ref, not rendered images. Visualization data is canonical; rendering is current.

## WHAT THIS SYSTEM DOES NOT OWN

* MTM Finding production — owned by MTM. LNV receives Findings after DNR routes them. LNV does not produce, modify, or interpret Findings.
* Cosmology finding production — owned by Cosmology page services (HCO, COS, CLM, NHM, RCT). LNV receives confirmed findings; it does not produce them.
* RCT residual production — owned by RCT. LNV receives residuals; it does not produce them.
* Engine computation — owned by individual engine services (Tier 3). LNV stores snapshots of computed visualizations; it does not trigger or own computation.
* WSC entry production — owned by WSC. LNV receives entries after WSC write path completes. LNV does not produce or modify WSC entries.
* Void analytical output — owned by Void. LNV receives outputs after Void session-close or on-demand analysis completes.
* Thread Trace sequence and visualization production — owned by Thread Trace. LNV receives processed outputs after Sage triggers deposit at session close. LNV does not build or own threads.
* Routing decisions — DNR routes MTM Findings. WSC routes its own entries. Void routes its own outputs. Engine visualization capture routes snapshots. Thread Trace routes its own outputs. LNV does not pull from any system — it receives.
* Content interpretation — LNV holds content in structural juxtaposition. It does not synthesize, interpret, editorialize, or draw conclusions across types. Juxtaposition is the method.
* Visualization rendering — owned by frontend Svelte components. LNV stores the data and template_ref; the component renders from stored data at display time.
* Deduplication — owned by callers. MTM deduplicates via content fingerprinting before Findings reach DNR. Other callers are responsible for not sending duplicates. LNV writes every receive call.

## DUAL ROLE — DISPLAY SURFACE AND DATA SOURCE

LNV is not just a gallery. It is also a data source.

**Display surface:** The LNV page shows all entry types in a unified gallery. Cards in responsive grid, filterable, sortable. Each card shows type badge, source system, date, content preview, sage note if present, prompt version if AI-authored. Expand on click for full content.

**Data source:** PCV reads mtm_finding entries from LNV as pre-processed input for hypothesis detection. PCV also reads cosmology_finding entries when findings are marked nexus_eligible. RCT reads rct_residual entries for accumulation tracking. Observatory reads recent entries for signal surface. Any system can query LNV's consolidated output through the read contract.

These are both first-class roles. The read contract exists because LNV is the single place where processed outputs from across the archive land. Systems that need to read those outputs read from LNV — not from the producing systems directly.

## THE SINGLE-TABLE ARCHITECTURE

One table. Seven entry types. All types share the same provenance fields (source_system, source_page, session_ref, prompt_version, sage_note). The content field is type-specific jsonb — each entry_type has a defined content shape.

**Why one table:** The gallery treats all types uniformly. Filtering by type is a query parameter, not a table join. PCV's read path (entry_type=mtm_finding) is a single filtered query. Adding a new entry_type requires adding an enum value and defining a content shape — no schema migration, no new tables, no new endpoints.

**Why type-discriminated content:** Each entry type carries different data. An engine_snapshot needs template_ref and visualization_data. An mtm_finding needs finding_type and provenance chain. A wsc_entry needs session_summary and handoff_note. The content jsonb field holds all of this, validated against the declared entry_type at receive time.

## SNAPSHOT STORAGE

Store data plus template, not rendered images.

Rendered images are large, non-queryable, and break if the template changes. Data plus template means the visualization re-renders from stored data, can be queried analytically, and stays correct if the display layer improves. The gallery thumbnail generates at display time from stored data — not a stored file.

template_ref is a string identifier mapping to a Svelte visualization component. The component knows how to render from the visualization_data object. If the component is updated, all historical snapshots re-render with the improved display. The data is canonical. The rendering is current.

Engine snapshots are Sage-triggered only. Session close does not automatically snapshot engine pages. The researcher decides what's worth preserving.

## SESSION-CLOSE POLICY

**Automatic at session close (via DNR):**
- MTM Findings (entry_type: mtm_finding)
- Void session-close pulse check output (entry_type: void_output)

**Sage-triggered at session close (Daily Nexus Routine):**
- Thread Trace processed outputs (Sage-triggered, entry_type: thread_trace)

**Outside session close:**
- Engine visualization snapshots (Sage-triggered, entry_type: engine_snapshot)
- WSC entries (after DNR completes, entry_type: wsc_entry)
- Void on-demand read outputs (Sage-triggered, entry_type: void_output)
- Cosmology findings (Sage-triggered on confirmed findings, entry_type: cosmology_finding)
- RCT residuals (automatic on residual creation, entry_type: rct_residual)
