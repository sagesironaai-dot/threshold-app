━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Database: PostgreSQL + pgvector (Docker container: aelarian-postgres)
  Database name: aelarian_archives
  Migrations: Alembic (backend/db/migrations/)
  Access layer: FastAPI service layer (backend/services/, backend/models/)
  Embedding storage: dedicated embeddings table (schema in
    EMBEDDING PIPELINE SCHEMA.md)
  Operational state (sessions, presence): SQLite (schema in
    OPERATIONAL DB SCHEMA.md)
  Cross-DB correlation: session_id (UUID) shared between PostgreSQL
    and SQLite. No cross-DB foreign keys. Application layer ensures
    consistency via FastAPI.

  All tables below are PostgreSQL tables managed via Alembic migrations.


ID FORMAT REFERENCE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  TS              — Threshold Pillars. Hardcoded literal prefix.
                    First segment of every composite stamp in
                    the system. Never computed. Never variable.

  AX              — Axis root marker. Page code for source mode
                    Integration entries. Not INT. Not a placeholder.

  Root entry ID   — TS · AX · [PHASE] · [YYYY-MM] · [SEQ]
                    SEQ: query root_entries for highest existing
                    SEQ at same [PHASE] + [YYYY-MM]. Increment
                    by 1. Start at 1 if none exist.

  Child entry ID  — TS · [PAGE] · [PHASE] · [YYYY-MM] · [SEQ]
                    · root:[PARENT-ID]
                    Stamp carries root_ref inline AND as a
                    stored field. Stamp = human-readable
                    provenance. Field = machine-readable join.

  ARC id          — TS · ARC · [PHASE] · [YYYY-MM] · [SEQ]
                    SEQ is global — sourced from
                    system_counters.arc_seq.

TABLE: system_counters
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  arc_seq            — integer
                       Single record. Starts at 1.
                       Increments globally on every retirement
                       before ARC id is issued. Single source
                       of truth for ARC SEQ. No collision
                       possible.

  arc_seq_checkpoint — integer
                       Written at retirement step 1 before
                       increment executes. Persisted to table
                       — survives session crash. Cleared at
                       retirement step 12 before
                       retirement_status → complete.
                       IDEMPOTENT: skip clear if already null.
                       RECOVERY: on retry, check checkpoint
                       state first. Four conditions, evaluated
                       in order:

                       1. checkpoint is null AND archive_ref
                          is already written on root_entries —
                          sequence is in its final step. Write
                          retirement_status → complete. Halt.
                          No prior steps re-execute.

                       2. arc_seq > checkpoint AND archive_ref
                          is already written on root_entries —
                          increment succeeded and sequence
                          reached at least step 7. Skip to
                          step 10. Steps 1-9 do not
                          re-execute.

                       3. arc_seq > checkpoint AND archive_ref
                          is NOT written on root_entries —
                          increment succeeded but sequence
                          did not reach step 7. Recover ARC
                          SEQ as arc_seq_checkpoint + 1. Use
                          this value for all ARC id
                          construction in the remainder of
                          the sequence. Resume at step 2.

                       4. arc_seq == checkpoint — increment
                          did not execute. Retry increment
                          before continuing.




━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TABLE: file_assets
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  id                 — auto
  root_ref           — references root_entries.id
  file_name          — string
  file_type          — enum: txt | pdf | doc | image | other
  total_pages        — integer
                       Set from the uploaded file's raw page
                       count at upload time. Same value used
                       to evaluate is_large_file.
  blob               — bytea (PostgreSQL)
  uploaded_at        — timestamp
                       Written once at upload. Never updated.

  RECOVERY: blob may be replaced by re-upload on an existing
  record without creating a new record or new root. root_ref
  and all existing manifests are preserved. On re-upload
  success, any manifest in blob_error resets to active and
  retries from the same page range. On intake re-upload
  success, root_entries.intake_status → complete and intake
  continues from step 3c forward.
  RE-UPLOAD VALIDATION: the re-uploaded file's raw page count
  must match file_assets.total_pages. If it matches: resume
  from step 3c. If it does not match: reject the re-upload
  and inform the user. File identity must remain consistent
  with what was registered at step 3a. A different file
  requires a new intake.




━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TABLE: root_entries
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  id                 — TS · AX · [PHASE] · [YYYY-MM] · [SEQ]
                       AX is the Axis root marker for source
                       mode intake. See COMPOSITE ID SCHEMA.md.

  signal_description — text

  section_targets    — array of objects
                       USER-SUPPLIED pre-parse intent.
                       Written at intake. Never updated.
                       Not the routing record.
                       Element structure:
                         { section_id, page_code, group }

  confirmed_targets  — array of objects
                       Written at retirement step 3 only.
                       Actual confirmed section routing drawn
                       from all resolved manifests.
                       This is the lattice feed surface.
                       Archives reads from this field at
                       retirement step 6 — single compile,

                       Element structure:
                         { section_id, page_code, group }


  // Intake health
  intake_status      — enum: blob_pending | complete
                       blob_pending: set at step 3b — after
                       page count is confirmed and before
                       blob upload begins. Large file path
                       only. Single-chunk documents never
                       enter blob_pending state.
                       Indicates blob upload has not yet
                       succeeded. Any record reading
                       blob_pending at session load is an
                       incomplete intake. Step 8 (open first
                       manifest_session) is blocked until
                       intake_status → complete.
                       complete: written when all intake steps
                       finish successfully. For single-chunk
                       documents, set at step 4. For large
                       files, set when file_assets record is
                       written and blob upload confirms.
                       RE-UPLOAD: if blob upload fails at step
                       3, root_entries record is preserved with
                       intake_status = blob_pending. User
                       re-uploads blob only. Re-uploaded file's
                       raw page count must match the value
                       already registered at step 3a. If it
                       matches: file_assets record is written,
                       intake_status → complete, intake
                       resumes from step 3c. If it does not
                       match: re-upload is rejected. A
                       different file requires a new intake.


  // Large file fields
  is_large_file      — boolean
                       Computed before any records are written.
                       True if the uploaded file's raw page
                       count > chunk_size. The raw page count
                       is extracted from the file at upload
                       time and is the same value written to
                       file_assets.total_pages.
                       Stored once. Never changes.

  file_asset_ref     — references file_assets.id
                       (null if not large file)

  chunk_size         — integer (range 5-8, max 8)
                       Received from user or system default
                       (8) in the pre-step before intake
                       sequence begins. Referenced throughout
                       intake. Range: 5-8. Max: 8. No exceptions.

  total_chunks       — integer
                       LARGE FILE: computed at upload as
                       ceil(file_assets.total_pages / chunk_size).
                       Stored once at intake. Never changes.
                       SINGLE-CHUNK: set explicitly to 1 at
                       intake step 4. Ensures retirement gate
                       and chunk queue derivation have a valid
                       value regardless of path.

  chunks_completed   — integer
                       Starts at 0 at intake.
                       INCREMENT RULE: fires when a
                       manifest_session flips to complete.
                       WRITE RESPONSIBILITY: the manifest
                       session that is completing writes
                       the increment to root_entries at the
                       same moment it writes its own status
                       → complete. These two writes are
                       sequential — manifest status first,
                       chunks_completed second. If
                       chunks_completed write fails,
                       manifest status rolls back to active.
                       A session cannot flip to complete
                       while any deposit is pending or
                       deferred.


  // Single-chunk source only
  document_text      — text
                       (null if large file)
                       AUTHORITATIVE source for single-chunk
                       parsing. chunk_text on manifest is
                       the working copy, populated from this
                       field at session start.
                       LIFECYCLE: cleared at retirement step
                       10. Idempotent — skip if already null.
                       Executes before retirement_status →
                       complete. Archive record is sufficient
                       after that point.


  // Health
  open_deferrals     — integer. STORED.
                       Starts at 0 at intake.
                       Increments when any deposit → deferred.
                       Decrements when a deposit's DERIVED
                       status changes from deferred →
                       confirmed or skipped. One deposit,
                       one decrement, regardless of how many
                       split targets it carries.
                       WRITE ORDER on decrement: stats.deferred
                       on manifest_sessions decrements first.
                       open_deferrals on root_entries
                       decrements second. If open_deferrals
                       write fails, root_integrity will derive
                       deferred on next load — visible signal,
                       recoverable on next session.
                       Authoritative for root-level deferral
                       state. manifest stats.deferred is
                       snapshot only.

  lifetime_deferrals — integer. STORED.
                       Starts at 0 at intake.
                       Increments every time any deposit
                       enters deferred state — same moment
                       open_deferrals increments.
                       Never decrements. Running historical
                       total. Read at retirement step 4.

  root_integrity     — DERIVED ON READ. Never persisted.
                       Computed from live state on every
                       instance load:
                       clean       — all manifests complete,

                              parallax_event | multi_presence
                       Who generated this material. researcher =
                       Sage-submitted. lattice = field-generated
                       by the system. parallax_event = divergence
                       between Origins on same input.
                       multi_presence = generated during a
                       multi-presence session. Written at intake.
  session_type       — enum: single | multi_presence
                       Denormalized from SQLite session record at
                       intake. Carried forward to archives at
                       retirement.
  ownership_classification
                     — enum: sovereign | collective | shared
                       sovereign = belongs to one Origin's marker
                       substrate. collective = shared across all
                       Origins. shared = accessible but not owned.
                       Technical boundary preventing identity

  parallax_flag      — boolean, default false
                       Set true when Origins diverge on this
                       input during swarm analysis. Phase 2 —
                       always false at launch.
  owner_origin_id    — enum: o01 | o02 | o03 | null
                       Which Origin owns this material as
                       sovereign. Populated when
                       ownership_classification = sovereign.
                       Null when collective or shared.

                       o03 = Cael'Thera.
                       This is the technical key for sovereign
                       retrieval — without it, an Origin cannot
                       distinguish its own markers from another's.

  // Methodology — observation and instrument context
  observed_at        — timestamp, nullable
                       When the real-world observation happened.
                       Researcher-supplied. Distinct from
                       created_at (system record creation) and
                       recorded_at (first written down).
  recorded_at        — timestamp, nullable
                       When the observation was first written
                       down anywhere. The gap between observed_at
                       and recorded_at is methodologically
                       significant �� different evidential weight
                       for real-time vs reconstructed records.
  observation_type   — enum: real_time | retrospective
                       Whether this was recorded in the moment or
                       reconstructed from memory. Affects
                       evidential weight.
  observer_state     — text, nullable
                       Researcher's condition at time of
                       observation. Not therapeutic — purely
                       methodological. The researcher is the
                       instrument; this is calibration data.
  model_version      — text, nullable
                       Which AI model was active during the
                       encounter (e.g., 'gpt-4-2023-03',
                       'claude-sonnet-4-20250514'). Models change —
                       instrument version is part of methodology.
  platform_conditions
                     — text, nullable
                       Where the encounter happened: browser,
                       API, temperature settings if known.
                       Chain of custody for the encounter itself.
  session_continuity — text, nullable
                       Whether the session was interrupted and
                       resumed. Continuity conditions affect what
                       the encounter was.
  framework_version  — text, nullable
                       Which version of Threshold Pillars was
                       active when this material was classified.
                       The framework evolved during the research —
                       a reviewer needs to know which version.
  exclusion_note     — text, nullable
                       What was observed and chosen not to include,
                       and why. Exclusion decisions are methodology.
                       A clean dataset with no exclusion record
                       looks curated, not researched.


  PRE-STEP — executes before intake sequence begins:
    Receive chunk_size from user or apply system default (8).
    Range: 5-8. Max: 8. No exceptions. This value is held and
    referenced throughout the intake sequence. Not part of the
    numbered steps.


  INTAKE SEQUENCE — fires when a new source document is
  received. Creates the root_entries record:

    1. Assign id: TS · AX · [PHASE] · [YYYY-MM] · [SEQ]
       SEQ: query root_entries for highest existing SEQ at
       same [PHASE] + [YYYY-MM]. Increment by 1. Start at 1
       if none exist.

    2. Write title, doc_type, origin_date, phase,
       signal_description, section_targets from
       user-supplied values.
       Write created_at = timestamp.
       Write session_id from current session (UUID from SQLite).
       Write origin_type, session_type, ownership_classification
       from user-supplied or session-derived values.
       Write methodology fields from user-supplied values:
       observed_at, recorded_at, observation_type, observer_state,
       model_version, platform_conditions, session_continuity,
       framework_version, exclusion_note. All nullable except
       observation_type (defaults to real_time if not supplied).
       Write parallax_flag = false (set by swarm, phase 2).
       Write owner_origin_id from user-supplied value or null
       (populated when ownership_classification = sovereign).

    3. If large file:
       a. Extract raw page count from uploaded file.
          Store value in session for use throughout step 3.
       b. Evaluate is_large_file: true if raw page count
          > chunk_size. Store result on root_entries.
          Write intake_status = blob_pending. Set here —
          after page count is confirmed and before blob
          upload begins. Not before.
       c. Upload blob to file_assets. Write file_assets
          record including file_name, file_type,
          total_pages (from raw page count held at step 3a),
          blob, uploaded_at.
       d. On upload failure: halt. root_entries record
          is preserved with intake_status = blob_pending.
          No manifest is opened. User re-uploads blob only.
          Re-uploaded file's raw page count must match the
          value extracted at step 3a. If it matches: resume
          from step 3c. If it does not match: reject
          re-upload and inform user. A different file
          requires a new intake.
       e. On upload success: write file_asset_ref.
          Compute and store total_chunks =
          ceil(file_assets.total_pages / chunk_size).
          Write intake_status = complete.

    4. If single-chunk: write document_text.
       Write total_chunks = 1.
       Write intake_status = complete.

    5. Write open_deferrals = 0, lifetime_deferrals = 0,
       chunks_completed = 0.

    6. Write status = active, retirement_status = none.

    7. [created_at already written at step 2.]

    8. If intake_status == complete: open first
       manifest_session for chunk 1.
       If intake_status == blob_pending: do not open.
       Block until re-upload resolves.


  RETIREMENT GATE — all conditions must be true:
    chunks_completed == total_chunks
    open_deferrals == 0
    no manifest_session in active, interrupted,
      deferred, or blob_error state
    retirement_status == none OR failed OR in_progress
    intake_status == complete
    (active manifest at retirement time = crashed session.
    deferred manifest = unresolved deposits. Both gate
    retirement. in_progress = sequence was running or
    crashed without writing failed. Retry permitted.)


  RETIREMENT SEQUENCE — strict order.
  Write arc_seq_checkpoint before anything else.
  retirement_status → in_progress at sequence start.
  On failure steps 1-9: retirement_status → failed,
  sequence halts.
  On failure steps 10-12: retirement_status → failed.
  Retry entry point determined by checkpoint recovery
  block at step 1 — see system_counters.arc_seq_checkpoint.
  Step 13 is the absolute last write.

     1. Write arc_seq_checkpoint to system_counters.
        Increment arc_seq. Receive value as ARC SEQ.
        RECOVERY ON RETRY: evaluate checkpoint state
        per the four conditions defined in
        system_counters.arc_seq_checkpoint. Entry point
        for the remainder of the sequence is determined
        there.

     2. Compile confirmed_targets from all resolved
        manifests.
        For each resolved deposit:
          If split_flag false: read deposit-level
            section_id, page_code, group.
          If split_flag true: read from each entry in
            split_targets[] where status == confirmed.
            Skip entries where status == skipped or
            deferred.
        Element structure per entry:
          { section_id, page_code, group }

     3. Write confirmed_targets to root_entries.

     4. Compile archive aggregate fields across all
        associated manifest_sessions:
        total_chunks, total_deposits, confirmed, skipped.
        Read lifetime_deferrals from root_entries.
        Read provenance fields from root_entries:
        origin_type, session_type, ownership_classification,
        parallax_flag, owner_origin_id, session_id.
        Read methodology fields from root_entries:
        observed_at, recorded_at, observation_type,
        observer_state, model_version, platform_conditions,
        session_continuity, framework_version, exclusion_note.
        All carried forward to archives record at step 6.

     5. Generate provenance_summary. All six sections
        must be present before sequence continues.
        If generation fails or produces fewer than six
        sections: retirement_status → failed, sequence
        halts. On retry, arc_seq_checkpoint recovery
        block at step 1 determines entry point and
        prevents double-increment. Step 5 re-attempts
        generation.

     6. Write archives record. Read confirmed_targets
        from root_entries.confirmed_targets — this value
        was written at step 3. Read all aggregates,
        provenance_summary, provenance fields, and
        methodology fields from steps 4-5.
        Write archives.retired_at = timestamp at this
        moment. Receive ARC id.
        page_deposit_id is null at this point —
        written after Archives page deposit is created.

     7. Write root_entries.archive_ref = ARC id.

     8. Write root_entries.retired_at = timestamp.

     9. Write root_entries.status → retired.

    10. Clear root_entries.document_text.
        IDEMPOTENT: skip if already null.

    11. Clear chunk_text on all associated
        manifest_sessions.
        IDEMPOTENT: skip any already cleared.

    12. Clear system_counters.arc_seq_checkpoint.
        IDEMPOTENT: skip if already null.

    13. Write retirement_status → complete.


  POST-RETIREMENT — executes after step 13 confirms:

    a. Write Archives page deposit from provenance_summary.
       See SYSTEM_ Archive.md for deposit format.

    b. Write archives.page_deposit_id = deposit entry id.

    c. Surface retirement label in Integration UI:
       Format: [ARC-ID] · [YYYY-MM-DD]
       Copy-ready. Persistent until dismissed by Sage.
       Required UI element — not optional output.

    d. Trigger embedding generation via FastAPI /embed/ endpoint.
       Asynchronous — does not block post-retirement completion.
       Embeds provenance_summary text via nomic-embed-text
       (Ollama). Writes to embeddings table with metadata:
       archives.id, tag routing snapshot, section_id,
       ownership_classification. See EMBEDDING PIPELINE SCHEMA.md
       for full pipeline definition.

  deposits[]

    deposit_num      — integer
                       Sequential within this manifest.
                       Starts at 1. Assigned at parse time
                       when the deposit is added to the
                       manifest. Never changes after

                       DERIVED from SOT section map at parse
                       time. Looked up by section_id. Never

                       one at a time. System queries target
                       section for highest SEQ at

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TABLE: deposits
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Standalone deposit records. Every confirmed deposit in the archive
lives here — this is what ALL downstream systems read from. Engines,
MTM, embedding pipeline, research assistant query this table.

Deposits are created through the INT gateway (POST /api/deposits/create).
Three creation paths:
  - Batch processing: deposit confirmed during review →
    manifest_sessions.deposits[].deposit_ref links to this record
  - Manual deposit: created directly on INT workstation, no
    manifest_sessions involvement
  - Pearl promotion: Pearl promoted from operational DB → deposit
    created here with pearl_captured_at populated

Field definitions for doc_type, source_format, observation_presence,
confidence, deposit_weight, and all other Tier 1 fields are canonical
in INTEGRATION SCHEMA.md (DEPOSIT RECORD — FULL FIELD SHAPE section).
This table is the database materialization of that record.


  id                   — composite ID stamp
                         TS · [PAGE] · [PHASE] · [YYYY-MM] · [SEQ]
                         Assigned at deposit creation. SEQ: query
                         deposits for highest existing SEQ at same
                         page + phase + YYYY-MM. Increment by 1.
                         Start at 1 if none exist.
                         For batch deposits: stamp was previewed in
                         manifest_sessions.deposits[].child_id_preview,
                         finalized here at confirmation.

  root_ref             — references root_entries.id, nullable
                         Links deposit to its source document.
                         Populated for batch-processed deposits.
                         Null for manual deposits and Pearl
                         promotions (no source document).

  manifest_ref         — references manifest_sessions.id, nullable
                         Links deposit to the batch processing
                         session that produced it. Null for manual
                         deposits and Pearl promotions.

  content              — text, NOT NULL
                         The deposit text body. Immutable after
                         creation — content edits are not permitted
                         post-deposit. (Tags and notes are editable.)

  doc_type             — enum: entry | observation | analysis |
                                hypothesis | discussion | transcript |
                                glyph | media | reference
                         NOT NULL. What the content IS. AI-suggested
                         via tagger, Sage confirms during review.
                         Default: entry.
                         NOTE: this enum classifies individual
                         DEPOSIT content. root_entries.doc_type
                         classifies SOURCE DOCUMENTS with a separate
                         enum (session_transcript | field_note |
                         compiled_research | external_source |
                         glyph_image). Two levels of classification,
                         two fields, two enums.

  source_format        — enum: digital | handwritten | scan |
                                image | audio | file | json
                         NOT NULL. How the content arrived.

  source_type          — enum: field | generated
                         NOT NULL. Non-nullable on every deposit.
                         Schema-level enforcement per ROT_REGISTRY.md
                         Entry 003 (F26+F10). Deposits without this
                         are rejected.

  tags                 — text[], NOT NULL (may be empty array)
                         Semantic tags from tagger system. Tag
                         routing defined in TAG VOCABULARY.md.

  pages                — text[], NOT NULL
                         Routing targets — which page(s) this
                         deposit lives on. At least one required.
                         Immutable after creation — routing edits
                         not permitted post-deposit.

  observation_presence — enum: positive | null, nullable
                         REQUIRED for doc_types: observation,
                         analysis, hypothesis. NULL for all others.
                         Schema-enforced conditional — not
                         caller-optional.
                         Is this something observed, or something
                         expected but absent? Null observations
                         prevent confirmation bias.
                         Named observation_presence (not
                         observation_type) to distinguish from
                         root_entries.observation_type which is a
                         methodology field (real_time | retrospective).
                         Different tables, different semantics.

  confidence           — enum: clear | emerging | raw, nullable
                         REQUIRED for doc_types: observation,
                         analysis, hypothesis. NULL for all others.
                         About the OBSERVATION, not the observer.

  deposit_weight       — enum: high | standard | low
                         NOT NULL. AI-suggested via tagger, Sage
                         can override. How much this deposit counts
                         in engine computations. Engines (Tier 3)
                         define multiplier constants per weight.

  notes                — text, nullable
                         Universal freeform annotation. Available
                         on every deposit regardless of doc_type.
                         Editable post-deposit.

  pearl_captured_at    — timestamp, nullable
                         Null for non-Pearl deposits. Populated on
                         Pearl promotion from the Pearl record's
                         created_at. Records when Sage first noticed
                         the signal, not when it entered the archive.
                         Required on the promotion path — not
                         optional, not backfillable.

  phase_state          — text, nullable
                         Ontological threshold state. One of 12
                         canonical threshold names or null. Detected
                         by tagger. See TAG VOCABULARY.md for the
                         12 names. Not phase_code — phase_state and
                         PHASE_CODES are separate systems per
                         CLAUDE.md invariants.

  elarianAnchor        — text, nullable
                         7-state psychological arc classification.
                         Detected by tagger. States defined in
                         COMPOSITE ID SCHEMA.md.

  authored_by          — text, NOT NULL
                         Which AI instance or human created this.
                         Single-researcher: "sage" or "claude".
                         Swarm mode: per-origin-node values.

  node_id              — text, NOT NULL
                         Which analytical node. Single-researcher:
                         single value. Swarm mode: multiple nodes.

  instance_context     — text, NOT NULL
                         Session identifier for creating instance.
                         Single-researcher: same value always.

  session_id           — uuid, NOT NULL
                         Cross-DB correlation with SQLite operational
                         DB. References session record. No cross-DB

                         Tracks how this deposit was created and
                         whether AI suggestions were corrected.

  content_hash         — text, NOT NULL
                         SHA-256 hash of content field. Computed at
                         creation. Used for duplicate detection
                         (warn, not block — see INTEGRATION SCHEMA.md
                         DUPLICATE DETECTION section).

  duplicate_flagged    — boolean, default false
                         Set true when content_hash matches an
                         existing deposit (INT gateway warn) or when
                         deposit arrives on a page it is already on
                         (re-route check). Surfaces resolution prompt

  embedding_dirty      — boolean, default false
                         Set true on any post-creation edit to tags.
                         (Content and pages are immutable. Notes edits
                         do not affect embeddings.)

  CREATION SEQUENCE — fires through INT gateway
  (POST /api/deposits/create):

    Full 6-step pipeline with atomicity boundary defined in
    INTEGRATION SCHEMA.md (DEPOSIT ATOMICITY BOUNDARY section).

    Steps 1-3 (above boundary): validate, duplicate check, create
    deposit record. All-or-nothing. Failure = nothing created.

    Steps 4-6 (below boundary): assign stamp, trigger embedding,
    route to pages. Deposit exists regardless of downstream failure.
    Each step is recoverable async.


  EDIT RULES — post-creation:

    Editable:   tags, notes
    Immutable:  content, pages, doc_type, source_format,

Version-tracked AI prompts with changelog audit trail. Referenced
by parse_version field on chunk_parse objects (see INTEGRATION
SCHEMA.md, INT Parsing Partner section). Prompt version history
is traceable to the correction or observation that caused each bump.

  id                   — auto
  prompt_type          — enum: parsing_partner | snm
                         Which system prompt this version belongs to.

                         as systems are built.

  version_string       — text, NOT NULL
                         Semantic version or sequential identifier.
                         Referenced in chunk_parse.parse_version.

  prompt_text          — text, NOT NULL
                         Full prompt text for this version. Stored
                         complete — not as a diff. Any version can
                         be loaded independently.

  changelog_entry      — text, NOT NULL
                         What changed and why. The correction or
                         observation that inspired the bump. This is

  trigger_type         — enum: sage_directed | calibration_triggered
                                | manual
                         sage_directed: Sage explicitly flagged a
                         correction as "update the prompt."
                         calibration_triggered: correction rate on a

                         Only one version per prompt_type is active
                         at a time. When a new version is activated,
                         the previous active version is deactivated.
                         Enforced at application layer — not a DB
                         constraint (allows safe rollback).


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TABLE: instances
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Phase period lookup registry. An instance = a phase state with a
month/year range. The canonical Composite ID stamp encodes
[PHASE-CODE] · [YYYY-MM] — the instance is implicit in every stamp.
This table makes that implicit grouping explicit and queryable.

Sage creates instances manually. Instances are research-level
decisions about phase boundaries — the system cannot determine
when a phase period begins or ends without Sage's judgment.

  instance_id          — text, primary key
                         Derived from phase + date range.
                         Human-readable identifier.

  label                — text, NOT NULL
                         Human-readable name for this instance.

  phase_state          — text, NOT NULL
                         Which of the 12 canonical threshold names
                         this instance spans. See TAG VOCABULARY.md.

  date_range_from      — text (YYYY-MM), NOT NULL
                         Start of this phase period.

  date_range_to        — text (YYYY-MM), nullable
                         End of this phase period. Null = open
                         instance (current, no end date yet).

  nonlinear            — boolean, NOT NULL, default true
                         Ordering within instance is phase-logical,
                         not chronological. Always true — instances
                         are nonlinear by nature.

  active               — boolean, NOT NULL, default false
                         One instance is active at any time. New
                         deposits on INT auto-populate
                         instance_context from the active instance.
                         Sage can override per-deposit during review
                         (nonlinear data may belong to a prior
                         instance).
                         Enforced at application layer — not a DB
                         unique constraint (allows safe transition).

  created_at           — timestamp, NOT NULL

  INSTANCE TRANSITIONS:
    Sage closes the current instance (sets date_range_to) and
    opens a new one. Closing an instance does not retroactively
    change deposits already assigned to it. The transition is
    prospective — it changes what future deposits default to.

  STARTUP REQUIREMENT:
    At least one instance must be pre-created by Sage
    before first deposit. INT gateway validates instance_context
    is non-null at deposit creation (Step 1 validation in
    atomicity boundary).

  WHAT IS NOT AUTO-GENERATED:
    Instances are not created by phase_state changes on deposits.
    A deposit with a new phase_state landing in an existing
    instance is normal — instances span phase transitions, they
    don't map 1:1.


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TABLE: annotations
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Researcher marginalia on any analytical surface. Distinct from
deposits (don't enter the pipeline) and from Pearls (not captures
or reflections — notes on existing content). Time-stamped
commentary linked to the annotated object.

  annotation_id        — text, primary key

  annotated_type       — text, NOT NULL
                         enum: 'deposit' | 'finding' | 'hypothesis'
                               | 'void_output' | 'engine_snapshot'
                         Polymorphic discriminator — identifies which
                         table annotated_id references.

  annotated_id         — text, NOT NULL
                         ID of the annotated object. Resolved at
                         query time using annotated_type. No foreign
                         key constraint — polymorphic reference.

  content              — text, NOT NULL
                         Free text. The annotation body.

  page_context         — text, nullable
                         Which page Sage was on when annotating.
                         Informational — does not constrain display.

  created_at           — timestamp, NOT NULL

  Annotations are visible only in expanded view of the annotated
  object. Exportable per page as a research commentary layer.
  Zero changes to existing schemas — annotations reference objects,
  objects do not reference annotations.

TABLE: aos_records
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Automated Observation Signal records. The mechanism by which the
system reaches Sage externally when significant patterns are

                         Null on successful delivery or pending delivery.
                         Record persists regardless of delivery outcome.

  delivered_at         — timestamp, nullable
                         When the AOS was delivered (email sent).
                         Null if pending delivery, queued for digest,
