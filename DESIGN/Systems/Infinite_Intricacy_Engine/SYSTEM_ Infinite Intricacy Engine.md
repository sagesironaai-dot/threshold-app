## WHAT THIS SYSTEM OWNS

* INF domain layer registry — open set of scientific domains. 5
  confirmed: harmonic_cosmology, coupling_oscillation,
  celestial_mechanics, neuro_harmonics, mirror_dynamics
* INF layer bridge mapping — TAG VOCABULARY layer_ids (l01–l04) mapped
  to INF domains via inf_layer_bridge config table. l03 maps to two
  domains (celestial_mechanics + harmonic_cosmology). Bridge is config,
  updatable without code changes
* INF layer presence computation — per domain weighted frequency vs.
  total examined
* INF intersection computation — every domain pair (5 domains = 10
  pairs). Observed vs. expected (marginal product baseline). Each
  intersection carries first_observed timestamp and deposit_ids list
* INF emergence timeline computation — per domain: first_appeared,
  frequency over time (bucketed monthly), dormancy events
  (gap then spike), current state
* INF dormancy detection — gap duration + spike count per domain
* Emerging domain detection — deposits with layer_ids not in bridge
  mapping logged as unmapped_layer_events. Does not trigger automatic
  domain creation (researcher review required)
* INF → Cosmology boundary contract — hands off layers_active,
  intersections array, emergence_timeline. Cosmology reads at its own
  cadence; INF does not push
* Three visualizations: density field map (d3-contour), emergence
  timeline, intersection detail
* inf_domain_layers table (domain definitions) and inf_layer_bridge
  table (TAG VOCABULARY → INF mapping)
* INF pattern_id format and generation
* INF-specific snapshot_data JSON structure
* INF failure modes

## WHAT THIS SYSTEM DOES NOT OWN

* Shared computation framework — owned by Engine Computation.
  Engine_Computation owns the four-step contract, baseline formula,
  deposit weight constants, signal classification, null observation
  flow, snapshot writes, and stale flag mechanics. INF implements
  its lens within that contract
* Cosmology investigation pages — Cosmology owns HCO, COS, CLM, NHM.
  INF hands off data via boundary contract; Cosmology owns
  interpretation and statistical testing
* Database table definitions — owned by INTEGRATION DB SCHEMA.md
  and OPERATIONAL DB SCHEMA.md
* Tag vocabulary and layer definitions (l01–l04) — owned by
  TAG VOCABULARY.md
* Entry data — owned by INTEGRATION DB SCHEMA.md
* MTM synthesis — MTM reads INF snapshots; INF does not participate
  in synthesis
* Scientific framework application — direction of inference is field
  observation outward, never established science inward

## LENS

Scientific domain layers. INF indexes deposits by resolving tag
layer_ids through inf_layer_bridge to INF domains. Multiple tags with
the same layer_id produce one domain presence (seed-level dedup).

Three computations: layer presence rates, domain pair intersections
(10 pairs), and per-domain emergence timelines with dormancy detection.

The boundary contract to Cosmology includes all domains regardless of
whether a Cosmology page exists — unnamed is not absent.

All mechanical detail in INFINITE INTRICACY ENGINE SCHEMA.md.

## NEXUS FEED

**Metamorphosis (MTM)**
Reads engine_snapshots — current, previous, delta. INF layer presences,
intersections, and emergence timeline consumed at synthesis time.

**Cosmology (Tier 5 investigation pages)**
INF → Cosmology boundary contract available for HCO, COS, CLM, NHM
investigation. Cosmology reads at its own cadence.

**Liber Novus (LNV · 47)**
Receives visualization_snapshots via POST /api/lnv/receive.
Auto-triggered on signal delta or Sage-triggered on demand.
