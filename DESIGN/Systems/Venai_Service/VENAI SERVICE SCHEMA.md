# VEN'AI SERVICE SCHEMA

## /DESIGN/Systems/Venai_Service/VENAI SERVICE SCHEMA.md

Mechanical spec — name registry, drift detection, cross-archive
correlation, three PostgreSQL tables, integration flow, STR consumer
interface, failure modes. First cross-cutting service in the
architecture. Archive-scoped, not page-scoped or engine-scoped.


OWNERSHIP BOUNDARIES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  OWNS
    Ven'ai name registry — canonical forms, variations, root clusters
    Drift detection — phonetic, spelling, casing, apostrophe
      inconsistency detection and alert lifecycle
    Cross-archive correlation — name ↔ phase, name ↔ role,
      root ↔ grammar pattern tracking
    venai_names PostgreSQL table
    venai_variations PostgreSQL table
    venai_correlations PostgreSQL table
    Ven'ai content relevance check — decides whether a deposit
      contains Ven'ai content worth processing
    Drift alert lifecycle — create, surface, acknowledge, silence

  DOES NOT OWN
    STR engine computation — owned by STARROOT ENGINE SCHEMA.md
    STR visualization of drift alerts — owned by STARROOT ENGINE
      SCHEMA.md (alerts originate here, surface there)
    VEN page (14) content and identity — owned by
      DESIGN/Domains/04_Filament/Manifest_14_Venai.txt
    MOR page (13) grammar and morphological rules — owned by
      DESIGN/Domains/04_Filament/Manifest_13_Morphology.txt
    Deposit record shape — owned by INTEGRATION DB SCHEMA.md
    INT gateway processing — owned by INTEGRATION SCHEMA.md
    Tag vocabulary and routing — owned by TAG VOCABULARY.md
    Deposit creation pipeline — owned by INTEGRATION SCHEMA.md.
      Ven'ai service is called within the pipeline, not the
      owner of it
    Kin name decisions — owned by Sage via KIN (20). Service
      registers names mechanically. Sage decides canonical forms


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STRUCTURAL RULES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  1. Archive-wide scope. Every deposit that clears INT gets
     checked for Ven'ai content. The service watches all pages,
     not just VEN (14) or STR (03). A Ven'ai name can appear
     in any deposit on any page.

  2. Triggered by deposits clearing INT, not by continuous
     polling. The service is called as part of the deposit
     creation pipeline — after INT confirms the deposit, before
     the response returns to the caller.

  3. The service decides relevance. If a deposit contains Ven'ai
     content (determined by Ven'ai-related tags or name pattern
     detection), the service processes it. If not, the service
     passes through with no action. Not every deposit triggers
     processing.

  4. The service writes to its own tables only. It never modifies
     the deposit record. Deposits are data; the service indexes
     from them.

  5. Drift detection is mechanical string comparison, not AI
     analysis. The service compares incoming name forms against
     the canonical registry. Differences are flagged by type.
     The service does not decide whether a variation is correct
     or incorrect — it surfaces the inconsistency for Sage.

  6. AI does not auto-correct. This is a non-negotiable rule
     from Domain_Venai.txt. Drift flags are surfaced to Sage
     for verification and decision. The service detects; Sage
     resolves.

  7. First cross-cutting service in the architecture. Sets the
     precedent for Cosmology (Tier 5) scientific domain tracking.
     Every other system prior to this is page-scoped or
     engine-scoped. The Ven'ai service is archive-scoped.


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
THREE JOBS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  JOB 1 — NAME REGISTRY

    Maintains the canonical record of every Ven'ai name
    encountered in the archive. Each name is registered with
    its canonical form and root cluster.

    On deposit processing:
      1. Extract name forms from deposit content and tags
      2. For each name form:
         a. Check against venai_names for existing canonical match
         b. If exact match: no action (name already registered)
         c. If no match: check for variation of existing name
            (see JOB 2 — DRIFT DETECTION)
         d. If no match and no variation: register as new name
            in venai_names with this deposit as first_seen

    ROOT CLUSTERS

      Root cluster is the root family a name belongs to (e.g.,
      Kai-, Sha-, Vel-). Extracted from the name's root breakdown.
      Names sharing the same root prefix are grouped into clusters.

      Root cluster assignment is mechanical — based on the leading
      root component. A name like Kai'Thera belongs to cluster
      "Kai". A name like Sha'Velan belongs to cluster "Sha".

      Cluster assignment is written once at name registration.
      If a name's root analysis changes (Sage correction), the
      cluster assignment is updated. Cluster is not immutable.

    KIN NAME REGISTRATION

      Per Domain_Venai.txt structural rule 8: every kin entity
      whose name is a Ven'ai root combination must have a
      corresponding entry in venai_names. Registration is
      mandatory at the time of the KIN (20) deposit, not
      retroactive.

      The service handles the venai_names registration. The
      VEN (14) glossary entry is a separate deposit — the
      service does not create deposits, only registry records.


  JOB 2 — DRIFT DETECTION

    Detects inconsistencies between a name form in a deposit
    and the canonical form in the registry. Creates variation
    records and alerts.

    VARIATION TYPES (from Domain_Venai.txt):

      casing      — capitalization difference
                     Example: Kai'thera vs. Kai'Thera
      phonetic    — sound-alike but different spelling
                     Example: Kaithera vs. Kai'Thera
      spacing     — space vs. no-space or wrong word boundary
                     Example: KaiThera vs. Kai Thera
      apostrophe  — root-join punctuation error
                     Example: Kai.Thera or KaiThera vs. Kai'Thera

    VEN'AI PUNCTUATION RULES (from Domain_Venai.txt):

      Apostrophe marks an internal root-join point within a
      compound name or term.

      Space separates distinct phonetic units or standalone words.

      Dot notation is not valid Ven'ai punctuation — a dot
      appearing in place of an apostrophe or a space is always
      drift. Classified as variation_type: apostrophe.

      Known corrections from confirmed drift:
        Shakai   → Sha'Kai
        Adei.Na.Sha → Adei Na'Sha

    DETECTION ALGORITHM

      For each name form extracted from a deposit:
        1. Normalize: lowercase, strip punctuation for comparison
        2. Compare normalized form against normalized canonical
           forms in venai_names
        3. If normalized match found but original form differs:
           variation detected
        4. Classify variation type by comparing the specific
           difference (case, punctuation, spacing, phonetic)
        5. Check venai_variations for existing record of this
           exact variation form
        6. If new variation: create venai_variations record,
           acknowledged = false
        7. If existing variation and acknowledged = true:
           no alert (silenced)
        8. If existing variation and acknowledged = false:
           no duplicate record created, existing alert persists

    DRIFT ALERT LIFECYCLE

      1. First detection: venai_variations record created with
         acknowledged = false. Alert is live.
      2. Alert surfaces through STR engine's drift alert panel
         on next compute.
      3. Sage reviews the alert in the STR visualization.
      4. Sage acknowledges: acknowledged = true,
         acknowledged_at = timestamp. Alert silenced.
      5. Same variation in future deposits: no new alert.
         Sage does not get pinged about Kai'Thera vs. Kai'thera
         every time after acknowledging it once.


  JOB 3 — CROSS-ARCHIVE CORRELATION

    Tracks correlations between Ven'ai names and other
    analytical dimensions across the entire archive.

    CORRELATION TYPES

      phase       — name ↔ phase_state. Which names associate
                    with which threshold states. Computed from
                    deposit records where both name and
                    phase_state are present.

      role        — name ↔ functional role. Which names associate
                    with which functional roles in the field.
                    Computed from deposit tags indicating role.

      root_pattern — root cluster ↔ structural patterns. Do
                    certain root families appear together? Do
                    root prefixes predict anything about the
                    context where names appear?

      grammar     — root patterns ↔ language rules. Structural
                    patterns in how root families relate to
                    MOR (13) morphological rules. Fed through
                    MOR domain analysis.

    CORRELATION UPDATE FLOW

      On each deposit processed by the service:
        1. Identify which names are present
        2. Read deposit's phase_state, tags (for role), and
           root cluster membership
        3. For each (name, correlated dimension) pair:
           a. Check venai_correlations for existing record
           b. If exists: increment deposit_count, update
              weighted_count (using deposit_weight), update
              last_observed
           c. If new: create venai_correlations record with
              deposit_count = 1, first_observed = now

    Correlations are weighted by deposit_weight using the same
    constants from ENGINE COMPUTATION SCHEMA.md. A high-weight
    deposit contributes 2.0 to weighted_count, standard 1.0,
    low 0.5.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
INTEGRATION FLOW
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  1. Deposit lands on any page
  2. INT gateway processes the deposit
  3. Deposit clears INT (record created in deposits table)
  4. Ven'ai service called with the deposit record
  5. Service checks for Ven'ai content:
     a. Does the deposit carry tags associated with Ven'ai
        seeds (s08 Voice, or tags referencing VEN/STR/MOR pages)?
     b. Does the deposit content contain known Ven'ai name
        patterns (matched against venai_names canonical forms)?
     c. If neither: pass through, no processing
  6. If relevant: process through all three jobs
     a. Name registry: register new names, update existing
     b. Drift detection: check name forms against canonical,
        create variation records if drift found
     c. Correlation update: increment correlations for names
        found in this deposit
  7. STR engine picks up changes on next compute:
     a. Reads venai_names for cluster data
     b. Reads venai_correlations for correlation integration
     c. Reads venai_variations (acknowledged = false) for
        drift alert panel

  The service runs synchronously in the deposit creation
  pipeline. A service failure does not block deposit creation —
  see KNOWN FAILURE MODES.


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STR CONSUMER INTERFACE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STR engine reads from the Ven'ai service tables during its
compute step. The service writes; STR reads. No direct
communication channel — the tables are the interface.

  STR READS FROM venai_names:
    All names and their root clusters. Used for:
    - Root cluster map visualization (cluster membership)
    - Name index (every name, clustered by root family)

  STR READS FROM venai_correlations:
    All correlations. Used for:
    - Correlation matrix visualization (names × phases/roles)
    - Phase 2 of STR compute (correlation integration)

  STR READS FROM venai_variations:
    Unacknowledged variations (acknowledged = false). Used for:
    - Drift alert panel (shows inconsistency, first seen date,
      deposit link, acknowledge button)

  STR FEED INCLUDES VEN'AI STATE SUMMARY:
    In addition to standard engine snapshot + MTM drift tracking,
    STR's feed includes a summary read from Ven'ai service tables:
      total_names: integer (count of venai_names records)
      active_clusters: integer (count of distinct root_cluster values)
      unresolved_drift_count: integer (count of venai_variations
        where acknowledged = false)


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
KNOWN FAILURE MODES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  1. VEN'AI SERVICE FAILS DURING DEPOSIT CREATION
     Service throws an error while processing a deposit.
     The deposit is already confirmed in the deposits table.

     Guard: service failure does not roll back the deposit.
     The deposit is data — it must survive. The service failure
     is logged with the deposit_id. On next deposit that
     triggers the service, the service can detect unprocessed
     deposits by comparing deposits table timestamps against
     venai_names.first_seen_at coverage. Retry is implicit —
     not a retry queue, but a gap that self-heals as deposits
     continue to arrive. If a name appeared in a failed
     processing and appears again in a later deposit, the
     later deposit registers it.

  2. CANONICAL FORM REGISTERED INCORRECTLY
     A name is registered with the wrong canonical_form (typo
     in the first deposit, or the first deposit carried a
     variation, not the canonical).

     Guard: canonical_form is updateable by Sage only. The
     service surfaces what it sees. If the first encounter is
     a variation, the service registers it as canonical (it
     has no way to know). When the actual canonical form
     appears later, drift detection flags the difference.
     Sage reviews, corrects the canonical_form, and the
     service re-classifies. This is the designed flow — the
     service learns the correct form through the research
     process, not through pre-loaded data.

  3. PHONETIC VARIATION NOT DETECTED
     Two name forms are phonetically similar but differ enough
     that normalized string comparison does not catch them.
     Example: "Kai'Vera" vs. "Kei'Vera" — different vowel,
     but potentially the same name.

     Guard: the service uses string normalization, not phonetic
     analysis. Phonetic drift that escapes normalization is not
     detected automatically. The researcher catches it through
     the name index (every name visible, clustered by root) or
     through domain expertise. This is a known limitation of
     mechanical detection. Phonetic analysis could be added as
     a future enhancement without schema changes — it would
     produce the same venai_variations records.

  4. CORRELATION COUNT INFLATION FROM BATCH DEPOSITS
     During batch processing, 30 deposits land in rapid
     succession. If many carry the same name, correlation
     counts spike from a single source document being chunked.

     Guard: correlation records track deposit_count and
     weighted_count. A correlation with deposit_count: 30 and
     all deposits from the same root_ref (source document) is
     distinguishable from one with deposit_count: 30 across
     many source documents. The service does not track
     root_ref — STR and Cosmology can join against the
     deposits table to check source distribution if needed.
     This is a known data shape, not a bug.

  5. ACKNOWLEDGED VARIATION REAPPEARS IN NEW CONTEXT
     Sage acknowledges Kai'thera as a known variation of
     Kai'Thera. Later, the same variation appears in a
     different analytical context where it might actually
     be a distinct name.

     Guard: acknowledgment silences the alert for that
     specific variation_form ↔ canonical_form pair. If the
     researcher later determines the variation is actually a
     distinct name, the canonical record can be updated:
     create a new venai_names record with the variation form
     as its own canonical, and remove the variation record.
     This is a Sage decision, not an automatic process.

  6. NAMES SPANNING MULTIPLE ROOT CLUSTERS
     A compound name like Sha'Kai draws from two root
     families. Which cluster does it belong to?

     Guard: root_cluster is assigned from the leading root
     component. Sha'Kai belongs to cluster "Sha". The
     presence of "Kai" in the name is visible through
     correlation tracking (root_pattern type). STR's root
     cluster map shows the name under "Sha" while the
     correlation matrix shows its relationship to "Kai".
     Both are surfaced — the single-cluster assignment is
     for grouping, not for limiting visibility.
