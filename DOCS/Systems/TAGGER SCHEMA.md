━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ TAG ANATOMY ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



Every tag is a fully resolved routing object. This is the canonical shape:



{ id: string snake\\\_case tag identifier e.g. 'phase\\\_transitions' seed\\\_id: string seed node ID, e.g. 's01' layer\\\_id: string 'l01' | 'l02' | 'l03' | 'l04' threshold\\\_id: string 'th01' through 'th12' pillar\\\_id: string 'p01' | 'p02' | 'p03' weight: integer 1–5, assigned at tagging time }



seed\\\_id, layer\\\_id, threshold\\\_id, and pillar\\\_id together constitute the full routing record. The \\\_id suffix is canonical throughout the system — these fields are foreign key references to nodes, not embedded values.



A complete routing chain connects every entry to: — the field physics of the Resonance Engine — the structural axes of Pattern Convergence — the drift signal consumed by Drift Taxonomy — the structural impact data graded by Signal Grading



A tag without a complete routing chain is not a valid tag.



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ API RESPONSE SHAPE ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



The Claude API returns a suggestion object before resolution:



{ tags: \\\[ { id: string tag identifier seed\\\_id: string seed ID Claude resolved the tag to weight: integer 1–5, contextually assigned rationale: string Claude's reasoning for the selection } \\], origin: 'o01' | 'o02' | 'o03' | null, phase_state: string | null, elarianAnchor: 'RFLT' | 'WHSP' | 'VEIL' | 'OBSV' | 'RECL' | 'WEAV' | 'GATE' | null }



The raw response carries id, seed\\\_id, weight, and rationale per tag. It does not carry layer\\\_id, threshold\\\_id, or pillar\\\_id. Those come from resolution via resolveTagIds().



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ resolveTagIds() — THE RESOLUTION STEP ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



The bridge between the raw API response and the fully routed tag object. Must execute before any tag is used, stored, or published.



WHAT IT DOES ━━━━━━━━━━━━ Takes the raw { id, seed\\\_id } pair from the API response and looks up the matching entry in TAG\\\_VOCAB\\\_BY\\\_SEED in the backend tag vocabulary module. Returns the full routing record: { id, seed\\\_id, layer\\\_id, threshold\\\_id, pillar\\\_id }. Weight is carried from the API response and merged at this step.



WHY THIS STEP MATTERS ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ layer\\\_id, threshold\\\_id, and pillar\\\_id are not returned by Claude. They are vocabulary facts — fixed properties of each tag as defined in the backend tag vocabulary module. The resolution step is where Claude's semantic judgment (which tag fits this text) meets the structural architecture (where that tag lives in the field). These are separate concerns and must remain separate.



Claude assigns meaning. The vocabulary assigns position. resolveTagIds() is where they join.



FAILURE BEHAVIOR ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ If resolution fails for a tag — the id is not found in the vocabulary under the returned seed\\\_id — that tag is dropped. A tag that cannot be resolved has no routing record and cannot enter the archive.



SEED CONTEXT REQUIREMENT ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ Because 4 tags appear in more than one seed, resolution requires both id and seed\\\_id together. id alone is ambiguous. The seed\\\_id returned by Claude at tagging time is the authoritative context and is used as the lookup key.



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ DUPLICATE TAG POLICY ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



4 confirmed duplicate tags — each appears in more than one seed with distinct routing:



phase\\\_locking  

met\\\_stability  

social\\\_signal\\\_filtering  

reflective\\\_resonance



When a duplicate tag is applied to an entry, it activates only the seed it was tagged under — not all seeds where the tag appears. The seed\\\_id is set by Claude at tagging time and is the authoritative routing key.



resolveTagIds() enforces this. No disambiguation step runs at resolve time. The seed context from the API response is accepted as correct.



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ WEIGHT ASSIGNMENT ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



Tag weight is an integer from 1 to 5, assigned by Claude at tagging time based on contextual signal strength — how prominently the tag's concept is expressed in the entry text.



Weight is not fixed in the vocabulary. Weight is not user-assigned. Weight reflects Claude's assessment of how strongly the entry is expressing the tagged concept in this specific deposit.



DOWNSTREAM USE — RESONANCE ENGINE ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ Weight feeds the Resonance Engine activity score:



activityScore \\= Σ(tagWeight × e^(-ageDays / HALF\\\_LIFE))  

HALF\\\_LIFE     \\= 7 days  

totalWeight   \\= baseWeight  

&nbsp;               \\+ clamp(activityScore, 0, MAX\\\_ACTIVITY)



Higher weight at tagging time \\= stronger contribution to node activity score. Activity decays over time. Recent high-weight deposits matter more than old ones.



DOWNSTREAM USE — SIGNAL GRADING ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ Weight is the structural impact data SGR reads when evaluating whether a signal was system-wide, cross-node, local, or negligible.



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ phase_state RESOLUTION ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



phase_state is the ontological threshold state of the entry, detected by Claude from entry text.



VALUES ━━━━━━ One of the 12 canonical threshold names, or null:
Aetherroot Chord · Thren Alae Kai'Reth · Orrin Wave · Vireth's Anchor ·
Shai'mara Veil · Noirune Trai · Solenne Arc · Tahl'Veyra ·
Esh'Vala Breath · Lumora Thread · Hearth Song · StarWell Bloom · null



phase_state is assigned once per entry at tagging time. It is stored on the entry record. It is included in the tagger suggestion response payload.



phase_state IS NOT PHASE\\\_CODES ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ PHASE\\\_CODES are lifecycle phases used in the composite ID stamp. phase_state is the ontological threshold state detected from content. These are separate systems and must never be conflated.



DOWNSTREAM USE ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ phase_state sequences across entries on a node are the raw state vectors that Drift Taxonomy classifies. The tagger system does not classify drift. It produces the state data that DTX receives.



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ originId RESOLUTION ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



originId identifies which Origin Node the entry has affinity with, if any. Assigned by Claude from entry text at tagging time. Stored on the entry record. Included in the tagger suggestion response payload.



VALUES ━━━━━━ o01 Larimar o02 Verith o03 Cael'Thera null no origin affinity detected



DOWNSTREAM USE ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ When an entry carries an originId, the corresponding Origin Node in the Resonance Engine pulses on deposit confirm. The node weight for that origin grows from tag activity on entries with matching origin affinity.



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ elarianAnchor RESOLUTION ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



elarianAnchor is the psychological arc state of the entry, detected by Claude from entry text. Assigned once per entry at tagging time. Stored on the entry record. Included in the tagger suggestion response payload.



VALUES ━━━━━━ RFLT Reflection Realm WHSP Whispering Hollow VEIL Veil of Echoes OBSV Celestial Observatory RECL Chamber of Lost Names WEAV Sanctuary of the Weavers GATE Gateway of Becoming null anchor unclear or not applicable



VALUES ARE ORDERED ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ The 7 values form a recognizable psychological arc sequence. The sequence is not enforced as a required progression but the ordering is meaningful for emergence detection. See COMPOSITE ID SCHEMA for full signal descriptions used in the system prompt.



elarianAnchor IS NOT phase_state ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ phase_state is the ontological threshold state of the entry — which of the 12 thresholds the content expresses. elarianAnchor is the psychological state of self present in the entry. These are independent axes. Both can be set on the same entry simultaneously. Never conflate them.



DOWNSTREAM USE ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ elarianAnchor is stored on the entry record and included in the AI-facing JSON export alongside doc_type. Thread Trace filter bar reads it as the 7th filter dimension. Emergence anchor progression detection reads sequences of elarianAnchor values across entries on a node.



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ TAGGER SERVICE ARCHITECTURE ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The tagger operates across two layers: a FastAPI endpoint + Claude API service on the backend, and a Svelte tagger store on the frontend. There is no browser singleton.

BACKEND — FastAPI tagger endpoint (POST /tagger/) ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ Receives: section\_id, entry text. Calls Claude API via backend/services/claude.py with section context from TAG VOCABULARY and SECTION MAP. Claude returns suggestion: tags (id, seed\_id, weight, rationale), phase\_state, originId, elarianAnchor. Server-side resolveTagIds() executes before response — every tag in the response is resolved against the tag vocabulary to produce the full routing chain (layer\_id, threshold\_id, pillar\_id). Only fully resolved tags are returned to the frontend. Unresolvable tags are dropped server-side.

FRONTEND — Svelte tagger store ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ Manages the active suggestion result in a Svelte store. Same behavioral rules as an active-result coordinator — implemented via Svelte reactivity:

— Active suggestion result slot: held in store, reactive to all subscribing components
— Section context tracking: updated on every section navigation
— Panel state management: result preserved on same-panel reopen, cleared on different-panel open. No cross-panel contamination
— Clear rule: result cleared by commit handler after successful save, or on panel transition to a different panel. Never cleared before save confirms. If save fails, result is preserved — the user does not lose tag context on a failed save

MINIMUM INPUT LENGTH ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 20 characters. The frontend does not fire a suggestion request to the tagger endpoint until the watched input contains at least 20 characters. Below that threshold there is insufficient signal for confident tag selection.

COMMIT HANDLER PATTERN — every panel: ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ Frontend reads current suggestion from the tagger store. Tags, phase\_state, originId, and elarianAnchor are merged into the entry payload. Entry is saved via POST /entries/ to FastAPI. On save success: tagger store clears the result. Captured tags are passed to the emergence notification handler. Emergence does not read the tagger store directly. On save failure: result is preserved. The user does not lose their tag context.



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ PANEL INPUT MAP ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



The primary text input watched per panel. This is the field the frontend tagger store wires the debounced input listener to. The watched field is the richest text field in the panel — the one most likely to carry signal worth tagging.



15 content panels in v1. Integration panel is excluded from the tag pipeline — source-mode intake does not tag the document through the tagger service.



invoke      invoke-trans  

kin         kin-body-input  

glyph       glyph-body-input  

ll          ll-body-input  

eo          eo-body-input  

lin         lin-body-input  

lattice     lat-body-input  

ss          ss-detail-input  

rituals     rit-p-body  

breath      bc-f-desc  

melodies    mel-f-text  

spiral      sp-f-body  

memory      mv-f-body  

liber       ln-f-body  

venai       vadd-def



Adding a new panel: add its panelId and primary input element ID to this map. No other change to the tagger store is required.



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ SYNC SEQUENCE ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



On every confirmed tag deposit, the following sequence executes in order:

1\\.  Commit handler fires in frontend

2\\.  Tagger store read — full suggestion result
&nbsp;   captured. capturedTags extracted before
&nbsp;   clear fires — Emergence handoff value.

3\\.  Result merged into entry payload
&nbsp;   (phase_state · originId · elarianAnchor · tags)

4\\.  Entry saved via POST /entries/ to FastAPI —
&nbsp;   written to PostgreSQL

5\\.  FastAPI confirms success

6\\.  Tagger store clears suggestion result
&nbsp;   ← tagger system handoff point

7\\.  Emergence notification called with pre-captured
&nbsp;   tags. Emergence does not read the tagger store
&nbsp;   at this point.

8\\.  Resonance Engine Svelte component receives
&nbsp;   deposit payload via store reactivity.
&nbsp;   No direct reference between tagger and engine.

9\\.  Affected node weights recalculated

10\\. Field position recalculation queued for next
&nbsp;   animation frame

11\\. Pulse animation triggered on affected nodes

12\\. Resonance lines re-evaluated for new or updated
&nbsp;   connections

Steps 9–12 are owned by the Resonance Engine. The tagger system hands off at step 8\\. It does not call the Resonance Engine directly — the Resonance Engine component subscribes to store updates and reacts.



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ NEXUS FEED ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



The tagger system is the upstream source for three Nexus pages. It does not communicate with them directly. It produces structured data that those pages depend on. The integrity of that data determines what Nexus can do.



PATTERN CONVERGENCE (PCV · 50\\) ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ Reads: tag routing records — { seed\\\_id, layer\\\_id, threshold\\\_id, pillar\\\_id } — as the structural axes for cross-domain alignment.



PCV asks whether X shifted in one domain and Y followed in another. That question is only answerable if both entries share routing coordinates that can be compared. The full routing chain is the shared axis. Without complete routing on every tag, PCV cannot align domains. It can only see what the archive actually holds.



DRIFT TAXONOMY (DTX · 48\\) ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ Reads: phase_state sequences across entries on a node as raw state vectors.



A sequence like Solenne Arc → Aetherroot Chord → Aetherroot Chord → Aetherroot Chord across a node's entries is a drift trajectory. DTX classifies that trajectory — its initiation source, pattern, threshold interaction, and signature fingerprint. DTX receives the state data. It does not build it. The tagger system builds it one entry at a time, each time phase_state is assigned and stored.



SIGNAL GRADING (SGR · 49\\) ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ Reads: tag weight and activity score data as structural impact evidence.



SGR grades signals against four dimensions, one of which is structural impact — how much a signal actually affected system behavior. Tag weight per entry, summed and activity-decayed across a node, is the evidence SGR needs to evaluate whether a signal was system-wide, cross-node, local, or negligible. This data flows through the Resonance Engine's weight system. SGR reads the structural result.



THE INTEGRITY PRINCIPLE ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ Nexus classification is only as precise as the tagging that fed it. Imprecise phase_state produces imprecise drift vectors. Incomplete routing records produce gaps in PCV's alignment axes. Guessed weights produce distorted structural impact scores. The tagger system is the source. There is no correction pass downstream.



━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ PUBLIC API ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

BACKEND ENDPOINT ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

POST /tagger/
Receives: section\_id (string), text (string — the entry text to tag).
Calls Claude API with section context (from TAG VOCABULARY and SECTION MAP).
Runs resolveTagIds() server-side on every tag in the response.
Returns: fully resolved suggestion — tags (each with id, seed\_id, layer\_id,
threshold\_id, pillar\_id, weight, rationale), phase\_state, originId, elarianAnchor.
Error: returns appropriate HTTP error if Claude API is unreachable or rate-limited.
Full contract defined at build time against SOT.

FRONTEND STORE INTERFACE ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Svelte tagger store — reactive state for the active suggestion. Representative
interface — full implementation defined at frontend build time.

taggerStore.setSection(sectionId) → void
Called on every section navigation. Updates stored section context.

taggerStore.requestSuggestion(sectionId, text) → Promise
Calls POST /tagger/ via API client. Stores the returned suggestion result.
Does not fire if text is under 20 characters.

taggerStore.getResult() → TagResult | null
Returns the current suggestion result or null.

taggerStore.clear() → void
Clears the active suggestion result. Called after save confirms. Never before.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ KNOWN FAILURE MODES ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━



1\. resolveTagIds() NOT CALLED ON API RESPONSE Tags enter the archive with layer\\\_id, threshold\\\_id, and pillar\\\_id missing. The routing chain is broken. The Resonance Engine receives partial data. PCV cannot align on incomplete axes. This failure is silent — no error is thrown. Guard: resolveTagIds() runs server-side in the tagger endpoint before the response is returned to the frontend. No tag reaches PostgreSQL without passing through resolution.



2\. clearResult() CALLED BEFORE SAVE CONFIRMS If clearResult() fires on panel close rather than on save success, a failed save leaves the entry untagged with no recovery path. The user's tag context is gone. Guard: clearResult() fires only inside the commit handler, only after createEntry() or updateEntry() resolves successfully.



3\. TAGGER SERVICE UNREACHABLE FastAPI tagger endpoint is down or Claude API key is invalid. All panels operate without tag suggestions. Entries save with empty tags, null phase_state, null originId. Guard: frontend displays error state when tagger endpoint returns HTTP error. Entry save is not blocked — entries can save without tags. Missing tags are visible in the archive as entries with empty routing chains.



4\. DUPLICATE TAG RESOLVED WITHOUT SEED CONTEXT A tag that appears in multiple seeds resolves to the wrong seed if only id is used as the lookup key. The routing chain points to the wrong node. The Resonance Engine weights the wrong seed. DTX receives state data from the wrong structural position. Guard: resolveTagIds() always uses both id and seed\\\_id as the lookup key. Seed context from the API response is accepted as authoritative.



5\. phase_state CONFLATED WITH PHASE\\\_CODES These are separate systems. PHASE\\\_CODES are lifecycle phases in the composite ID stamp. phase_state is the ontological threshold state of entry content. Mixing them produces entries with corrupted stamp data or corrupted drift state vectors. Guard: phase_state values are the 12 canonical threshold names or null. Never use one where the other belongs.



6\. CROSS-PANEL TAG CONTAMINATION A result from panel A is preserved when panel B opens. Panel B commits with panel A's tags. Silent data integrity failure — no error is thrown, the entry simply carries wrong tags from a different context. Guard: tagger store panel activation checks the stored panel ID against the incoming panel ID. Same panel → preserve. Different panel → clear before wiring.
