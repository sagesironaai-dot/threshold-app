## **WHAT THIS SYSTEM OWNS**

* Seven-detector pattern analysis engine — runs as FastAPI service-layer analysis (backend/services/emergence.py), using pgvector similarity queries for cross-entry pattern detection  
* Three-mode overlay — translation · timeline · trace (Svelte components)  
* On-demand finding narratives via Claude API (routed through backend/services/claude.py)  
* Proactive nudge — scheduled pattern scan with cooldown, triggered by FastAPI  
* Thread Trace bridge — hands off findings to Thread Trace Svelte component for thread navigation  
* Graph export — assembles ThreadGraphPayload for the graph page  
* Findings persistence — findings write through FastAPI to PostgreSQL (findings table)

## **WHAT THIS SYSTEM DOES NOT OWN**

* Tag session logic or pipeline — owned by tagger service (backend/services/claude.py, backend/routes/tagger.py)  
* Thread navigation or overlay — owned by Thread Trace Svelte component and thread trace service  
* Database schema definitions — owned by SQLAlchemy models (backend/models/) and INTEGRATION DB SCHEMA.md  
* Writes to entries — read-only analysis layer. It never modifies what it reads.  
* Entry schema — owned by SQLAlchemy models (backend/models/)

## **SEVEN DETECTORS**

Each detector runs across the tag set and entry corpus passed to `runDetectors()`. Each produces zero or more findings. All findings share the canonical finding shape defined below.

Detector thresholds are calibration constants. Starting reference values are given here. All are marked PLANNED — confirm at build.

### **1\. Cluster**

Builds a co-occurrence graph from tag → entry membership. Tags that appear together in entries form connected components. Components above the minimum size threshold are flagged as cluster findings.

CLUSTER\_MIN\_SIZE \= 3    — minimum tags to flag a component as a cluster

A cluster finding means: these tags consistently co-occur. They activate together. The pattern is structural, not coincidental.

### **2\. Bridge Node**

Identifies tags with high bridgeScore — tags that connect otherwise separate clusters. A bridge node sits between two or more distinct communities in the co-occurrence graph. Its removal would disconnect them.

BRIDGE\_THRESHOLD \= 0.65    — bridgeScore above this \= bridge node

A bridge finding means: this tag is load-bearing. It is the connective tissue between domains that would otherwise not touch. High structural significance.

### **3\. High Influence**

Identifies tags with high equilibriumState — tags whose activation reliably precedes or accompanies activation of many other tags. Influence is not the same as frequency. A tag can appear rarely and still carry high influence if its appearances consistently pull other tags into activation.

INFLUENCE\_THRESHOLD \= 0.78    — equilibriumState above this \= high influence

A high influence finding means: when this tag appears, the field moves.

### **4\. Cross-Category**

Identifies pairs of tags from different seeds or pillars that share entries above the minimum threshold. Cross-category findings surface connections the routing architecture did not predict — places where field signal is crossing structural boundaries.

CROSS\_CAT\_MIN\_ENTRIES \= 2    — minimum shared entries to flag a cross-category link

A cross-category finding means: two structurally separate domains are touching in the field. This is the interference pattern PCV reads.

### **5\. Drift**

Identifies tags that were active in recent phases but have faded — their presence is declining across the phase window. Drift findings name what is losing signal rather than gaining it.

DRIFT\_PHASE\_WINDOW \= 2    — phases back to check for fading tag presence

A drift finding means: this tag was load-bearing and is receding. DTX receives these findings as named drift events for trajectory classification.

### **6\. Void Zone**

Identifies sections with low tag coverage — sections where entries exist but are not being tagged, or are being tagged at a rate far below the corpus average. A void zone is a gap in the signal map.

VOID\_COVERAGE\_FLOOR \= 0.3    — sections with \< 30% tagged entries \= void zone

A void finding means: there is field activity here that the tagging system has not reached. The data exists. The routing does not.

### **7\. NPA Spike**

Identifies sessions where non-primary arc tags dominate — where the tags activated do not align with the primary arc of the active section. A spike suggests the session is producing signal outside the expected routing path.

NPA\_SPIKE\_RATIO \= 0.4    — non-primary arc tags \> 40% of session \= spike

An NPA spike finding means: the field is producing signal that is not landing where the architecture expects it. May indicate an emergent routing need or a misaligned section assignment.

---

## **SEVERITY CRITERIA**

Every finding carries a severity of `low`, `medium`, or `high`. Severity is not an aesthetic judgment. It is a structural assessment based on the finding's scope, persistence, and routing implications.

low  
  — Pattern is present but narrow in scope  
  — Affects a single section or a small tag subset  
  — No evidence of cross-domain propagation  
  — Watchlist only — no immediate routing action required

medium  
  — Pattern spans multiple sections or involves a structurally significant node  
  — Appears in more than one detection pass  
  — Cross-domain signal present but not yet convergent  
  — Worth tracking actively — may escalate

high  
  — Pattern is system-wide or involves a bridge node or high-influence tag  
  — Appears consistently across multiple sessions or phases  
  — Cross-domain convergence confirmed or strongly indicated  
  — Requires routing attention — input to DTX classification and SGR grading

Severity is assigned by the detector at finding creation time. It is not retrospectively adjusted by the Emergence system. SGR re-evaluates signal weight against documented outcomes independently.

---

## **FINDING SHAPE**

All seven detectors produce findings in this canonical shape:

{  
  id:            string    — 'emg\_\[timestamp\]\_\[rand\]'  
  type:          string    — 'cluster' | 'bridge' | 'influence' | 'cross\_category'  
                             | 'drift' | 'void' | 'npa\_spike'  
  title:         string    — human-readable label for the finding  
  description:   string    — structural description of what was detected  
  severity:      string    — 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'  
  metrics:       object    — numeric values from the detector calculation  
                             e.g. { bridgeScore: 0.72, entryCount: 14 }  
  involvedTags:  object\[\]  — tags implicated in the finding  
  involvedEntries: object\[\] — entries implicated in the finding  
  canTrace:      boolean   — true if Thread Trace component can open a thread from this finding  
}

`involvedEntries` is what Thread Trace reads when building an Emergence thread from a finding. `canTrace` gates the "Trace this pattern" button in the overlay.

Findings write through FastAPI to the PostgreSQL findings table (see INTEGRATION DB SCHEMA.md). Each detection pass writes its findings to the database with full provenance. Thread Trace reads findings from PostgreSQL when building threads. Findings are queryable across sessions — they are not ephemeral.

---

## **THREE OVERLAY MODES**

All three modes render inside the same overlay shell. Tab navigation switches modes without closing the overlay.

### **translation**

Renders the findings from the most recent tag session — what the current set of tags produced across the seven detectors. Primary mode after a tag commit. Shows finding cards with metrics, involved tags, severity, and trace button.

### **timeline**

Renders the entry corpus bucketed by time — a structural view of when signal arrived and how it distributed across phases and sections. Used for temporal pattern review independent of a specific tag session.

### **trace**

Renders findings with Thread Trace integration foregrounded. Trace buttons are prominent. Designed for navigating from a finding into a full thread. `openFromFinding()` opens the overlay directly in this mode.

---

## **CLAUDE API USAGE**

The Emergence system makes two distinct types of Claude API calls.

### **requestNarrative(finding)**

On-demand. Called when the user requests an explanation of a specific finding. Returns a narrative that translates the structural finding into field-language — what this pattern means in the context of the Threshold Pillars framework.

This is not interpretation added to the finding. It is a translation of what the detector already measured, expressed in the language of the framework.

### **Proactive Nudge**

Scheduled. Runs automatically after a detection pass if findings above a significance threshold are present and the cooldown has elapsed.

NUDGE\_COOLDOWN\_MS   \= 4 min    — minimum interval between proactive nudge calls  
NUDGE\_INIT\_DELAY\_MS \= 4000ms   — delay before first scan after app load

The nudge surfaces a single high-significance finding as a non-blocking notification. It does not open the overlay. It invites attention without demanding it.

Finding deduplication: findings already surfaced in the current session are tracked by key (`type::title`). The nudge does not repeat findings the user has already seen in this session.

**Model:** claude-sonnet-4-20250514 for all Emergence API calls.

## **PUBLIC API**

BACKEND ENDPOINTS

All emergence operations route through FastAPI. The service reads entries and tags directly from PostgreSQL — no injected fetcher pattern. Representative endpoints — full contracts defined at build time against SOT.

POST /entries/{id}/detect — run detection pass
  — Triggered after tag commit. Runs all seven detectors against the current
    entry corpus using pgvector similarity queries.
  — Writes findings to PostgreSQL. Returns findings array.

GET /entries/findings — query findings
  — Returns findings filtered by type, severity, section, or time range.
  — Supports pagination. Findings are persistent and queryable across sessions.

POST /entries/findings/{id}/narrative — request finding narrative
  — Triggers Claude API call via backend/services/claude.py.
  — Returns narrative text — a translation of what the detector measured.

GET /entries/findings/nudge — proactive nudge check
  — Returns the highest-significance unseen finding if cooldown has elapsed.
  — Does not repeat findings already surfaced in the current session.

FRONTEND INTERFACE

Svelte Emergence component — three overlay modes, finding cards, trace button,
nudge notification. Calls FastAPI endpoints via API client.

open(mode) — opens overlay in 'translation' | 'timeline' | 'trace' mode
openFromFinding(finding) — opens overlay in 'trace' mode focused on a finding
requestNarrative(finding) — calls narrative endpoint, displays result

---

## **COMMIT HOOK — onTagSessionComplete()**

After every panel save, the frontend triggers a detection pass:

1. Entry saved via POST /entries/ to FastAPI — written to PostgreSQL.
2. Tagger store clears suggestion result.
3. Frontend calls POST /entries/{id}/detect with the entry id.
4. Emergence service runs all seven detectors against the current corpus.
5. Findings written to PostgreSQL. Response returned to frontend.
6. If overlay is open, frontend refreshes with new findings.
7. Proactive nudge evaluated — if warranted, nudge notification surfaces.

**Corpus freshness rule:**

The detection pass always queries entries fresh from PostgreSQL. It does not rely on cached data. The entry that just triggered the commit is the reason the analysis is running — running detectors on a corpus that does not yet include that entry is structurally incorrect. The finding produced would miss the most relevant connection.

The performance cost is one database query per commit. This is acceptable.

---

## **THREAD TRACE BRIDGE**

`openFromFinding()` hands off to the Thread Trace Svelte component, passing the finding data. The Svelte component import handles the dependency — no circular dependency concern (Svelte resolves component imports at build time, not at runtime).

`canTrace` on a finding gates the "Trace this pattern" button in the overlay. The button renders when the Thread Trace component is available. In the Svelte architecture, components are always available once mounted — the gate is effectively always true when the app is running.

---

## **NEXUS FEED**

**Pattern Convergence (PCV · 50\)**

Reads: cluster, bridge, and cross-category findings as interference pattern data.

These three detector types specifically produce the cross-domain signal PCV is designed to receive. A cross-category finding that tags from s04 and s15 share entries is exactly the kind of structural relationship PCV aligns on shared axes. Emergence does not interpret these findings. PCV does. Emergence names them with precision so PCV has something structurally solid to work with.

**Drift Taxonomy (DTX · 48\)**

Reads: drift findings as named drift events for trajectory classification.

Emergence detects that a tag is fading. DTX classifies whether that fading is linear escalation, oscillation, fragmentation, or containment. The drift detector produces the event. DTX provides the taxonomy. DTX also receives the phase window and entry context embedded in the finding — that is the raw state data its classification runs against.

**Liber Novus (LNV · 47\)**

Receives: processed Emergence findings routed through Thread Trace or deposited directly as part of the Daily Nexus Routine.

Findings land on LNV with provenance intact: finding id, type, severity, involved tags, and the session context in which they were produced. LNV holds them without editorializing. The findings are traceable to the detection pass that produced them.

## **SEQUENCES**

### **INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE**

FastAPI startup initializes the emergence service. No injected fetcher — the service
reads from PostgreSQL directly. Proactive scan scheduled after NUDGE\_INIT\_DELAY\_MS
from first request.

### **TAG SESSION COMPLETE SEQUENCE — fires after every panel save**

1. Entry saved via POST /entries/ — written to PostgreSQL.
2. Frontend calls POST /entries/{id}/detect with the entry id.
3. Emergence service queries fresh entry corpus from PostgreSQL. Includes the
   just-committed entry.
4. All seven detectors run against tags and fresh corpus. Findings written to
   PostgreSQL.
5. Proactive nudge evaluated: if high-severity findings exist, cooldown has
   elapsed, and finding keys are not in seen set — nudge fires.
6. If overlay is currently open: frontend refreshes with new findings.

Failure at step 3 (database query fails): detector pass cannot run. Findings not
  produced. Overlay not updated. Guard: query failure returns HTTP error. Frontend
  surfaces the error. System returns to idle — no crash.
Failure at step 4 (one detector throws): that detector returns empty array.
  Remaining detectors continue. Guard: each detector runs independently. A failure
  in one does not halt others.
Failure at step 5 (cooldown not enforced): nudge fires repeatedly in one session
  for the same finding. Guard: seen keys tracked by type::title key.
  Entries added after each nudge call. Cooldown timer checked before every nudge.

---

## **KNOWN FAILURE MODES**

**1\. Emergence service unreachable** FastAPI emergence endpoints are down. Detection passes do not run. Findings are not generated. Proactive nudge never fires. Guard: frontend displays error state when detection endpoint returns HTTP error. Entry save is not blocked — entries save without triggering detection. Missing findings are visible as gaps in the findings timeline.

**2\. Detection pass on stale corpus** If the detection service queries entries before the just-committed entry is visible in PostgreSQL, the detector pass misses the most relevant connection. Finding produced is structurally incomplete. Guard: detection runs after the entry write transaction commits. The service queries entries fresh from PostgreSQL at the start of every detection pass. Never use cached data at commit time.

**3\. pgvector query timeout** Similarity queries across a large corpus exceed the query timeout. Detection pass returns partial or no results. Guard: pgvector queries use appropriate index (IVFFlat or HNSW) for performance. Query timeout returns error, not partial results. Frontend surfaces the timeout. Retry is safe — detection is idempotent.

**4\. Findings not deduped across nudge calls** Same finding surfaces as a nudge multiple times in one session. User sees repeated notifications for the same pattern. Guard: seen keys tracked by type::title within the session. Nudge only fires for findings with keys not yet seen.

**5\. Graph export before graph page exists** Graph page route is a stub. Routing there before the page is built produces dead navigation. Guard: graph export remains disabled until the graph route is live. Update graph route reference in both emergence and thread trace components together — never one without the other.

**6\. Claude API failure during narrative request** Claude API is unreachable or rate-limited when a finding narrative is requested. Guard: endpoint returns appropriate HTTP error. Finding data is still available — only the narrative translation is missing. Frontend displays the finding without narrative and allows retry.
