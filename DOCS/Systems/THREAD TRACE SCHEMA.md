FOUR THREAD TYPES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  All four use the same overlay shell. The builder changes.
  The UI does not.


  TEMPORAL
  ━━━━━━━━
  Orders entries chronologically along a shared arc or phase
  trajectory.

  Scoping:
    Seed is an entry → scopes to entries sharing the same
      phase_state or section as the anchor.
    Seed is a tag → scopes to entries carrying that tag.
    Seed is a finding → scopes to the finding's
      involvedEntries.

  Fallback: if the scoped pool contains fewer than 3 entries,
  falls back to the full corpus automatically.

  Temporal is the default fallback for any thread type that
  cannot execute with the given seed.


  RELATIONAL
  ━━━━━━━━━━
  Traverses entry-to-entry links via linkedEntries on each
  entry, then extends outward through shared tag routing to
  fill depth.

  Traversal: BFS from the seed entry.
    MAX_DEPTH = 4 hops
    MAX_ENTRIES = 30

  Fallback: if the seed is not type 'entry', falls back to
  TEMPORAL.

  ACTIVE BLOCKER: Relational threads require linkedEntries to
  be populated on entries. Until entries carry valid
  linkedEntries data, Relational threads fall back to TEMPORAL
  silently. The builder is written and ready — it activates
  when the data exists.


  CLUSTER
  ━━━━━━━
  Groups entries that share a dominant tag cluster.

  Seed can be a tag ID or an entry. If entry, the dominant tag
  from that entry's routing record anchors the cluster.

  Entries are ranked by tag overlap count with the seed
  cluster. Operates on the full corpus — no section scoping.


  EMERGENCE
  ━━━━━━━━━
  Entries linked by Emergence findings and co-occurrence
  patterns. Seed is a finding object from the emergence
  service.

  Builder reads involvedEntries from the finding and extends
  outward through shared tag routing.

  Bridges to the emergence detection service via FastAPI —
  fires fresh detection or uses an existing finding passed
  from the Emergence overlay.


SEED RESOLUTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  resolveSeed() normalizes any raw entry point into a typed
  seed object before the thread builder receives it. All three
  entry points route through resolveSeed() before
  buildThread() is called.


  SEED SHAPE
  ━━━━━━━━━━
  {
    type:        'entry' | 'tag' | 'finding' | 'query'
    id:          string | object
                 entry ID, tag ID, finding object, or
                 query string
    threadTypes: string[]
                 preferred thread types for this seed,
                 in priority order
  }


  RESOLUTION RULES
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  finding object (has findingType or involvedTags)
    → type: 'finding'
    → threadTypes: ['emergence', 'cluster']

  raw seed object with explicit threadTypes
    → type guessed from id prefix or pattern
    → threadTypes: carried from raw object

  plain string starting with tv_ or matching short-code pattern
    → type: 'tag'
    → threadTypes: ['cluster', 'temporal']

  plain string (entry ID)
    → type: 'entry'
    → threadTypes: ['relational', 'temporal']

  query string (free text, no matching ID pattern)
    → type: 'query'
    → threadTypes: ['temporal', 'cluster']


  QUERY SEED TYPE
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  A query seed scopes entries by text content match rather
  than requiring a known entry ID, tag ID, or finding object.
  Enables ad-hoc pattern exploration without a specific
  anchor — the difference between "trace from this entry" and
  "trace everything related to X."

  Thread type defaults to TEMPORAL scoped by content match,
  then CLUSTER by dominant tag overlap in the matched set.


THREE ENTRY POINTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  All three call open(rawSeed) which routes through
  resolveSeed() → buildThread().

  | Surface          | Trigger                      | Seed shape                |
  |------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
  | Entry meta strip | Trace action on any entry    | { seed: entry.id,         |
  |                  | element in the UI            |   threadTypes:            |
  |                  |                              |   ['relational',          |
  |                  |                              |    'temporal'] }          |
  |------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
  | Tag pill         | Context action on any tag    | { seed: tag.id,           |
  |                  | element in the UI            |   threadTypes:            |
  |                  |                              |   ['cluster',             |
  |                  |                              |    'temporal'] }          |
  |------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
  | Emergence        | "Trace this pattern" action  | { seed: findingObj,       |
  | finding card     |                              |   threadTypes:            |
  |                  |                              |   ['emergence'] }         |

  Entry points are wired in the ThreadTrace Svelte component.
  Trigger actions are bound via Svelte event handlers on
  entry, tag, and finding elements rendered by their
  respective components.

  ENTRY FETCH SCOPING
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  When a panel is active: entry fetch API call includes the
  active section as a query parameter. Threads opened from
  within a panel are section-scoped by default and can be
  broadened via the filter bar.

  When no panel is active: full corpus is fetched from API.


TWO VIEWS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Both views render inside the same overlay shell. The user
  can switch between them without closing the thread.

  SEQUENCE VIEW
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Ordered card list. Each card represents one entry in the
  thread. Navigation is linear — previous / next — with a
  progress bar showing position in the sequence.

  Card content: title · body preview · phase_state ·
  elarianAnchor · origin affinity · dominant tag routing ·
  edge label connecting to the next card.

  GRAPH VIEW
  ━━━━━━━━━━
  Structural map of thread entries as nodes with edges. Edge
  labels show the relationship between connected entries —
  shared tag, explicit link, phase transition, or temporal
  interval.

  Graph export assembles a ThreadGraphPayload and routes to
  the graph page.

  PLANNED: graph page path — GRAPH_PAGE_PATH = '/graph',
  defined in frontend/src/lib/config.ts. Graph export is a
  stub until then. Graph export button remains disabled until
  GRAPH_PAGE_PATH is a live route. Thread Trace owns graph
  export readiness coordination. Before enabling graph export,
  verify both ThreadTrace and Emergence components import from
  the same config constant and route to the same path.


FILTER BAR
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Active across both views. Six filter dimensions:

    pillar_id       p01 | p02 | p03
    seed_id         s01–s40
    layer_id        l01–l04
    threshold_id    th01–th12
    phase_state     canonical threshold name | null
    elarianAnchor   RFLT | WHSP | VEIL | OBSV | RECL |
                    WEAV | GATE
    section         any section ID

  elarianAnchor values sourced from COMPOSITE ID SCHEMA.

  Filters are applied at buildThread() call time. Changing a
  filter rebuilds the thread against the current corpus with
  the new constraints. Filter application runs server-side
  via FastAPI query parameters when fetching entries.

  PRE-POPULATION
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  On overlay open, the component reads the tagger Svelte store
  and maps its routing dimensions to the filter bar. If the
  tagger store has an active result, the filter bar opens
  pre-scoped to that context.


TAGGER STORE RELATIONSHIP
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Thread Trace is a read-only consumer of the tagger Svelte
  store. It reads at two moments and never writes to it.

  | Moment          | What Thread Trace does        | Source              |
  |-----------------|------------------------------|---------------------|
  | On overlay open | Reads active filter state     | tagger store        |
  |                 | to pre-populate filter bar    | (Svelte subscribe)  |
  |-----------------|------------------------------|---------------------|
  | On thread save  | Included in routing snapshot  | tagger store        |
  |                 | assembly                     | (Svelte get)        |

  If the tagger store has no active result, Thread Trace
  degrades gracefully — filter bar opens empty, routing
  snapshot records null filter state.


EDGE LABELS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  generateEdgeLabel(entryA, entryB, threadType) is a pure
  function. No external calls. Produces a human-readable label
  for the relationship between two adjacent entries in a
  thread.

  LABEL LOGIC BY THREAD TYPE
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  TEMPORAL
    phase transition if phase_state differs between entries:
      'Solenne Arc → Vireth's Anchor'
    temporal interval if same phase:
      '3d apart' | '2w apart' | '1mo apart'
      'same day' if within the same calendar day

  RELATIONAL
    'explicit link' if entries reference each other via
      linkedEntries
    up to two shared tag IDs if no explicit link:
      'phase_transitions · criticality'
    'routing proximity' if no shared tags

  CLUSTER
    dominant shared tag ID

  EMERGENCE
    '↑ [shared tag]' for co-occurrence link
    'pattern link' if no shared tags identifiable


ROUTING SNAPSHOT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Built at save time from the thread's full entry set. Stored
  with the saved thread record in PostgreSQL. Read by Pattern
  Convergence as cross-domain alignment data.

  Shape:
  {
    dominantPillar_id:    string | null
    dominantSeed_id:      string | null
    dominantLayer_id:     string | null
    dominantThreshold_id: string | null
    entryCount:           integer
    edgeCount:            integer
    threadType:           string
    distributions: {
      pillars:    { [pillar_id]: count }
      seeds:      { [seed_id]: count }
      layers:     { [layer_id]: count }
      thresholds: { [threshold_id]: count }
    }
  }

  getTagRoutingSummary(entries) aggregates routing distribution
  across the entry set. buildRoutingSnapshot(threadResult)
  wraps that summary into the payload-ready shape above.


SAVED THREADS AND ANNOTATIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Saved threads and annotations are stored in PostgreSQL via
  FastAPI /threads/ endpoints. Thread logic runs in the Svelte
  frontend; persistence is server-side.


  TABLE: saved_threads (PostgreSQL)
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  id                   — text, primary key
                         Format: 'thr_[timestamp]_[rand]'

  name                 — text, not null
                         User-defined at save time.

  thread_type          — text, not null
                         One of the four thread type values.

  seed                 — jsonb, not null
                         Serialized seed. Finding objects
                         reduced to key fields only for
                         JSON safety.

  entry_ids            — text[], not null
                         IDs of entries in the thread at
                         save time.

  filter_state         — jsonb, nullable
                         Active filter at save time.
                         Null if tagger store had no active
                         result.

  tag_routing_snapshot — jsonb, not null
                         Routing snapshot — see above.

  created_at           — timestamp, not null

  last_accessed        — timestamp, not null

  is_deleted           — boolean, not null, default false


  SOFT DELETE
  ━━━━━━━━━━━
  Delete endpoint sets is_deleted = true. Does not remove the
  record. List endpoint filters deleted records automatically.


  touchThread()
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Updates last_accessed without modifying any other field.
  Called when a saved thread is re-opened from the thread list.
  Implemented as a PATCH /threads/{id}/touch endpoint.


  loadThread() BEHAVIOR
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Load endpoint returns the saved record including entry_ids.
  The frontend fetches the live entries separately using those
  IDs via /entries/ API and passes them to buildThread() for
  re-render. This keeps saved threads current — the entries
  they reference reflect any updates made since the thread
  was saved.


  TABLE: thread_annotations (PostgreSQL)
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  id                   — text, primary key
                         Format: 'ann_[timestamp]_[rand]'

  thread_id            — text, not null
                         Foreign key to saved_threads.id.

  text                 — text, not null

  timestamp            — timestamp, not null

  filter_snapshot      — jsonb, not null
                         Active filter state AND sequence
                         position index at the moment the
                         annotation was written. An
                         annotation knows exactly where in
                         the thread it was made — which
                         entry was visible, which filters
                         were active.


  ANNOTATION RULES
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Annotation requires a saved thread. If the user attempts to
  annotate before saving, the save dialog opens first with the
  annotation queued. After save confirms, the annotation is
  written with the new thread ID.

  Annotations are queried via JOIN on thread_id — no
  denormalized mirror needed. PostgreSQL handles this
  efficiently as a standard foreign key relationship.


SESSION-ONLY STATE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  The current unsaved thread is held in a Svelte store. No
  API call or DB write until the user explicitly saves.

  Thread store holds:
    currentThread    — the active ThreadResult or null
    isOverlayOpen    — boolean

  Store is cleared when the overlay closes or a new thread
  is opened. It is not cleared on panel transitions — thread
  state persists through panel changes intentionally.


SEQUENCES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  THREAD BUILD — strict order
  1. Receive raw seed (entry id, tag id, finding object, or
     query string).
  2. Call resolveSeed(rawSeed) → typed seed object
     { type, id, threadTypes }.
  3. Fetch entry corpus from FastAPI /entries/ endpoint —
     scoped to active section via query parameter if a panel
     is active, full corpus if no panel is active.
  4. Apply filters to corpus using current filter state.
     Filtering runs server-side as query parameters on the
     /entries/ request.
  5. Select thread builder: iterate seed.threadTypes in
     priority order. Select first builder that can execute
     with the given seed type. If none can execute: fall back
     to TEMPORAL.
  6. Run selected builder against filtered corpus.
  7. Generate edge labels between all adjacent entry pairs
     via generateEdgeLabel().
  8. Store thread result in Svelte thread store.
  9. Render in overlay — sequence view as default.

  Failure at step 2: seed cannot be resolved → surface error.
    Do not open overlay.
  Failure at step 3: API call fails → surface error. Do not
    open overlay.
  Fallback at step 5: if selected builder cannot execute,
    fall back to TEMPORAL silently. Name the fallback in the
    UI — do not leave the user without context.

  THREAD SAVE — strict order
  1. Build routing snapshot: getTagRoutingSummary(entries) →
     buildRoutingSnapshot(threadResult).
  2. Read active filter state from tagger Svelte store.
     Null if store has no active result — record null, do not
     block save.
  3. Receive thread name from user.
  4. POST /threads/ — write saved_threads record with all
     fields, created_at = timestamp, last_accessed = timestamp.
  5. Return thread id.
  Failure at step 4: API call fails. No partial record written.
    Surface error. Retry permitted.

  ANNOTATION SAVE — strict order
  1. Validate thread is saved (thread_id exists on current
     session thread). If not: open save dialog. Queue
     annotation. Proceed only after save confirms with valid
     thread_id.
  2. Capture filter_snapshot: active filter state + sequence
     position index at annotation time.
  3. POST /threads/{id}/annotations — write annotation record
     with id, thread_id, text, timestamp, filter_snapshot.
  Failure at step 3: annotation not written. Surface error.
    Retry permitted.

  THREAD LOAD — strict order
  1. GET /threads/{id} — retrieve saved_threads record.
  2. Response includes entry_ids.
  3. Frontend fetches live entries using entry_ids via
     GET /entries/ with ID filter.
  4. Frontend passes live entries to buildThread() for
     re-render.
  5. PATCH /threads/{id}/touch — writes last_accessed.
     No other field modified.
  Note: entries reflect any updates made since the thread
    was saved. Thread Trace holds IDs only — it does not
    reconstruct entries.


NEXUS FEED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  PATTERN CONVERGENCE (PCV · 50)
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Reads: tag_routing_snapshot from saved threads — dominant
  routing dimensions and full distributions across the
  thread's entry set.

  PCV uses saved thread snapshots as named cross-domain signal
  sources. A saved thread's routing distribution is a
  pre-aggregated alignment axis: the dominant seed_id,
  pillar_id, threshold_id, and layer_id across a coherent set
  of entries. PCV can align these against outputs from other
  domains without re-opening the thread.

  LIBER NOVUS (LNV · 47)
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Receives: processed Thread Trace outputs — sequence traces
  and structural visualizations built from thread data.

  Thread Trace outputs that have been processed into findings
  land on LNV as part of the Daily Nexus Routine. They arrive
  with provenance intact: thread type, seed, routing snapshot,
  and entry set are all traceable. LNV holds them without
  editorializing.

  DRIFT TAXONOMY (DTX · 48)
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Reads: phase_state sequences surfaced by Temporal threads.

  A Temporal thread ordered by originDate across a node's
  entries makes drift trajectories visible as a navigable
  sequence. The phase_state transitions between cards — the
  edge labels that read 'Solenne Arc → Aetherroot Chord' —
  are the state vectors DTX classifies. Thread Trace makes
  the trajectory legible. DTX receives it.


PUBLIC API
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Frontend (Svelte — src/lib/)
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Thread logic module — pure logic, no DOM, no API calls

    resolveSeed(rawSeed) → Seed
      Normalizes any raw entry point into a typed seed object
      before the thread builder receives it.
      Returns { type, id, threadTypes }.

    buildThread(seed, entries, filters?) → ThreadResult
      Selects and runs the appropriate builder based on
      seed.threadTypes priority. Falls back to TEMPORAL if the
      preferred builder cannot execute. Returns the ordered
      entry set and thread metadata.

    generateEdgeLabel(entryA, entryB, threadType) → string
      Pure function. Produces a human-readable label for the
      relationship between two adjacent thread entries.
      No external calls.

    getTagRoutingSummary(entries) → RoutingSummary
      Aggregates tag routing distribution across an entry set.

    buildRoutingSnapshot(threadResult) → RoutingSnapshot
      Wraps getTagRoutingSummary() output into the
      payload-ready routing snapshot shape. Called at save time.

  ThreadTrace Svelte component — overlay UI

    Renders overlay shell, sequence view, graph view, filter
    bar, annotation layer. Binds entry point triggers via
    Svelte event handlers. Reads tagger store for filter
    pre-population. Writes to thread Svelte store for
    session state.

  Thread Svelte store — session state

    currentThread: ThreadResult | null
    isOverlayOpen: boolean
    Cleared on overlay close or new thread open. Persists
    through panel transitions.

  Backend (FastAPI — /threads/)
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

    POST   /threads/
      Create saved thread record. Returns thread id.

    GET    /threads/
      List saved threads (is_deleted = false).

    GET    /threads/{id}
      Load saved thread record including entry_ids.

    DELETE /threads/{id}
      Soft delete — sets is_deleted = true.

    PATCH  /threads/{id}/touch
      Update last_accessed only.

    POST   /threads/{id}/annotations
      Create annotation on saved thread.

    DELETE /threads/{id}/annotations/{ann_id}
      Delete annotation.

    GET    /threads/{id}/annotations
      List annotations for a thread.


KNOWN FAILURE MODES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  1. RELATIONAL THREAD WITH NO linkedEntries DATA
     Falls back to TEMPORAL silently. No error thrown. User
     sees a temporal thread where they expected a relational
     one, with no indication of why.
     Guard: name the fallback in the UI when it occurs —
     "Relational thread unavailable: no entry links found.
     Showing temporal view."

  2. ANNOTATION WRITTEN BEFORE THREAD IS SAVED
     Annotation has no thread ID to reference. Silent failure
     or orphaned record.
     Guard: save dialog opens before annotation is written.
     Annotation is queued and written only after save confirms
     with a valid thread ID.

  3. THREAD OPENED FROM PANEL WITH ACTIVE SECTION SCOPING
     Entry fetch is scoped to the active section via API query
     parameter. A thread that should span multiple sections
     returns a subset. User may not realize the thread is
     section-scoped.
     Guard: display active scope in the filter bar header. If
     section filter is active from panel context, make it
     visible and clearable.

  4. GRAPH EXPORT BEFORE GRAPH PAGE EXISTS
     GRAPH_PAGE_PATH = '/graph' is a stub. Routing there
     before the page is built produces dead navigation.
     Guard: graph export button remains disabled until
     GRAPH_PAGE_PATH is a live route. Thread Trace owns
     coordination — verify both ThreadTrace and Emergence
     components are updated together. GRAPH_PAGE_PATH defined
     in frontend/src/lib/config.ts.

  5. API UNAVAILABLE DURING THREAD BUILD
     FastAPI /entries/ endpoint unreachable. Thread cannot
     fetch corpus.
     Guard: API call failure surfaces a named error in the
     UI. Overlay does not open. No partial thread rendered.

  6. API UNAVAILABLE DURING THREAD SAVE
     FastAPI /threads/ endpoint unreachable. Thread data
     assembled but cannot persist.
     Guard: save failure surfaces a named error. Thread
     remains in Svelte store (session state). User can retry
     save when API is available. No data lost — the thread
     result is held in memory until explicitly cleared.

  7. STALE ENTRY IDS ON THREAD LOAD
     A saved thread references entry_ids that no longer exist
     (entries deleted or IDs changed since save).
     Guard: frontend fetches live entries by ID. Missing IDs
     return empty. The thread renders with available entries
     and surfaces a notice: "N entries from this thread are
     no longer available." The saved record is not modified —
     the original entry_ids are preserved as historical
     reference.
